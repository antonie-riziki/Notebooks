      "{'if everyone thinks youre worthless then maybe you need to find new people to hang out withseriously the social context in which a person lives is a big influence in selfesteemotherwise you can go round and round trying to understand why youre not worthless then go back to the same crowd and be knocked down againthere are many inspirational messages you can find in social media \\xa0maybe read some of the ones which state that no person is worthless and that everyone has a good purpose to their lifealso since our culture is so saturated with the belief that if someone doesnt feel good about themselves that this is somehow terriblebad feelings are part of living \\xa0they are the motivation to remove ourselves from situations and relationships which do us more harm than goodbad feelings do feel terrible \\xa0 your feeling of worthlessness may be good in the sense of motivating you to find out that you are much better than your feelings today': 0, 'hello and thank you for your question and seeking advice on this feelings of worthlessness is unfortunately common in fact most people if not all have felt this to some degree at some point in their life you are not alone\\xa0changing our feelings is like changing our thoughts  its hard to do our minds are so amazing that the minute you change your thought another one can be right there to take its place without your permission another thought can just pop in there the new thought may feel worse than the last one my guess is that you have tried several things to improve this on your own even before reaching out on here people often try thinking positive thoughts debating with their thoughts or simply telling themselves that they need to snap out of it  which is also a thought that carries some selfcriticism\\xa0some people try a different approach and there are counselors out there that can help you with this the idea is that instead of trying to change the thoughts you change how you respond to them you learn skills that allow you to manage difficult thoughts and feelings differently so they dont have the same impact on you that they do right now for some people they actually do begin to experience less hurtful thoughts once they learn how to manage the ones they have differently acceptance and commitment therapy may be a good choice for you\\xa0there is information online and even selfhelp books that you can use to teach you the skills that i mentioned because they are skills they require practice but many people have found great relief and an enriched life by learning them\\xa0as for suicidal thoughts i am very glad to read that this has not happened to you still you should watch out for this because it can be a sign of a worsening depression if you begin to think about this it is important to reach out to a support system right away the national suicide prevention lifeline is  the text line is \\xa0i hope some other colleagues will provide you more suggestions\\xa0be wellrobin landwehr dbh lpcc': 1, 'first thing id suggest is getting the sleep you need or it will impact how you think and feel id look at finding what is going well in your life and what you can be grateful for i believe everyone has talents and wants to find their purpose in life i think you can figure it out with some help': 2, 'therapy is essential for those that are feeling depressed and worthless when i work with those that are experiencing concerns related to feeling of depression and issues with self esteem i generally work with my client to help build coping skills to reduce level of depression and to assist with strengthening \\xa0self esteem by guiding my client with cbt practices cbt helps with gaining a better awareness of how your thought process influences your\\xa0belief system and how your beliefs impact your actions and the outcome of your behaviors \\xa0this process isn’t easy but it helps teach an individual that we don’t always have control over what happens in our lives but we can control how we interpret feel and behave cbt is good for individuals dealing with depression anxiety toxic relationships stress self esteem codependency etc': 3, 'i first want to let you know that you are not alone in your feelings and there is always someone there to help you can always change your feelings and change your way of thinking by being open to trying to change you can always make yourself available to learning new things or volunteering so that you can make a purpose for yourself': 4, 'heck sure thing hunfeelings

there a particular timeof day a specific person who brings it out a phrase you hear juststart to notice usually its tied to something but it may take a while to figure out what that somethingsomeone is try to be patientnext we start to explore when did these feelings start where do you think they come from is there something  a statement  perhaps that repeats in your head over and over again if so whose voice is it these are difficult questions and just a few of them so take your time answering them we usually do it over a few sessions it might even be helpful to write them down somewhere if you have a journal that would be a great place as research has shown that our brain works differently when we put pen to paper versus typing on a computer now comes the good news our brains are able to rewire themselves this allows us to change habits we dont want as well as statements we say to ourselves that are no longer serving us the next step is to select an ally someone who is or has been in your corner someone who is always rooting for you if you dont have someone like that thats ok  a lot of us dont  you can just make someone up close your eyes and try to describe that person in great detail from the way they look to the way they act to the way they sound now pick a phrase you would like that person to say to you whenever you start to think that youre worthless something that will help you feel better about yourself  a characteristic a skill a great joke you tell a physical attribute this also takes time and may involve you asking for help from someone who knows youonce you have all of that together  the noticing answers from where these feelings and statements come from your ally your new statement you can try to put it altogether when the feelings come up notice what is bringing them up and then call upon your ally to try to change the statement in your head from the selfdefeating one to the more positive uplifting one i hope this was helpful again i do this with my clients over quite a few weeks if not months and i am there with them the whole time it is quite an involved process and can bring up a lot of very difficult feelingmemories if at any point

you are feeling this way \\xa0we all have narratives that we say to ourselves whether it is valid or not \\xa0in your case it would be beneficial to explore when and how this belief began and rewrite your story \\xa0there are different ways to explore and rewrite \\xa0this process requires commitment selfreflection and courage': 22, 'let me start by saying there are never too many concerns that you can bring into counselling in fact most people who come to see me for counselling have more than one issue they would like to work on in psychotherapy and most times these are all interconnected in counselling we work together collaboratively to figure out which issues you would like to address first and then together we develop an individualized plan of care basically it’s like a road map of where you want to go how are you going to get there looking at stopovers some scenic routes others possibly not so scenic however necessary of course these plans can also change due to internal what we have control over like our thoughts feelings and behaviours or external reasons those things that are outside our control i would encourage you to take the next step and reach out to a professional

restful sleep amongst other things please do not feel hesitant because the fact that you know what you want to discuss and work on is amazing you know the directions you want to go and the therapist

issues these issues are often linked so that helping one issue will positively help the other issues': 51, 'the short answer is absolutely not the longer answer is that it might take some time to process all of the issues and it may feel quite muddy in the issues for a lot longer than is tolerable which is why counseling may have been postponed to begin with for you its important to be realistic when entering counseling of any sort and that the therapist be realistic with you about what you might be able to expect working with that person i use the words might be able to expect because therapy experiences can vary but that not having counseling about trauma that you have experienced much earlier in your life can play a significant role in the process and how long that process could take to unpack all that may have been buried over timeit might also be helpful in counseling to work with the therapist on figuring out where to begin but to also manage the feelings of being overwhelmed that may make it hard to continue to show up and do the work required week in and week out it isnt easy work trying to process past pain that you experienced and so consistent practice of selfcare including leaning on support systems outside of therapy is key': 52, 'usually people who struggle with depression also have symptoms of anxiety these symptoms come about as a result of underlying causes the obstacles you have been overcoming such as abuse cancer and insomnia likely bring about similar feelings and emotions in you which affect your selfesteem counseling is meant to support people who have layers of difficulties we see the difficulties as layers to an onion peeling away the many layers': 53, 'often times when an individual begins the counseling process it is revealed that there is more than one thing going on when we think about how much is wrong it can be overwhelming and we may not know where to even start counseling can provide guidance to help

counseling\\xa0 all of the issues you mention above can be successfully worked through in counseling': 55, 'absolutely not when we have the courage to accept the challenge to address whatever is causing us pain the solutions often generalize to many if not all of our symptoms i would suggest that unresolved trauma from sexual abuse is likely a primary contributing factor however it is important that you first build a trusting relationship with a therapist experienced in trauma treatment as this is an area of specialty that not all therapists are skilled in treating choosing one issue to work on such as anxiety or depressive symptoms and starting there will allow you the opportunity to get to know your therapist learn coping skills for managing distressing symptoms and establish emotional safety before jumping into trauma work': 56, 'hello thereno one has too many issues to address in counseling once you start counseling your therapist will help you identify which

be a good fit and again it could take a couple of first sessions with different therapists to know if someone is a good fit sometimes it can take a few sessions and if there is no one around that can

those around us to create happiness in our lives then we lose the opportunities for us to do it ourselves we are entirely capable of finding ways to be happy sometimes this entails working out issues

about your life as it is right now what can you do to create change in your life to increase your happiness these kinds of questions can be valuable to you as you seek out ways to make happiness an internal rather than an external event mourning the loss of a social connection in whatever way that occurred is part of the grieving process but it is not permanent it is a path to healing and moving forward from this you can seek out new sources of happiness i encourage you to remember that happiness is independent of the external experience you have in the world happiness is an expression of the internal feelings so that will be the source or the font of positive emotion from which you really draw if you are lacking in happiness then it becomes important to examine why that is and what you can do about it to promote selfcare seeking out a professional counselor can also be a good option as you move through the griefloss process and examine the reasons happiness is not in greater supplyi

define who you are or to get a selfesteem boost who you are and how you feel about yourself needs to come from inside not from outside one way you can have a better relationship with your parents is

or the internet for more ways to practice meditation please go for it\\xa0yoga on the other hand will take a little more work and practice i would not suggest you learning this on your own if you have never attempted yoga before find an experienced yoga instructor to teach you the ropes andor ask your school counselor about the possibility of getting someone to come to the school to teach the students\\xa0lastly in regards to your parents it is very important to be able to have a relationship where you feel comfortable communicating i would recommend writing a letter to them if you are

important to this personc consequence you feel depressedif you look at the model b has a direct effect on c the thought is if you change your reaction to a then c will have a better consequence such

cannot stress this enough although some people tend to minimize their abusers behavior ie they only do it when they are drinking they only do it when they are mad it’s those individuals that find themselves or their children in a serious situation so you can never take abuse physical or mental lightly because you never know what is going through that persons mind at that particular time it’s

to understand this much more with them and what this nervous and scared experience is all about perhaps starting with the question whats the earliest memory you have of feeling uncomfortable around people the idea would be to try to understand all of what it means for you to be around people and the history of the experience without labeling it wrong or passing judgment on itfrom there what might come is that certain people and their character traits might be harder to be around for you because of experiences that youve had with similar situations in your life or it could certainly be

we arent as distracted at night and our resources are more depleted so we cant fight back against these thoughts as effectively as usual\\xa0it can be helpful to externalize our anxiety give it a name like judy or bill for example or perhaps something more sinister like lord garmadon the naming is all up to you what comes to mind for you when you think of your anxiety now what is a name thats

of your personality this is usually helpful\\xa0additionally i recommend not avoiding the situations that make you feel this way our brains have to learn what is an actual threat and what is not right now your brain thinks that crowds are a threat if you can practice some deep breathing and stay in the crowd you will start to teach or rewire your brain letting it know that the crowd is not

existential anxiety might be unique to you  it is very difficult for most people to really comprehend what happens after we die  regardless of the religious or philosophical belief systems we hold it is the ultimate unknown and some philosophers and psychologists believe that at the root of our daytoday anxieties is the fear of death or fear of the unknown \\xa0just as it can be really hard to

you are  relax and regulate your nervous system so that you are able sleep and recuperate and train your attention to focus on living the life you want to live now  rather than worrying about what happens after you die\\xa0having said all that  it can be profoundly helpful to speak with someone about your anxiety  especially when you feel haunted by it worry that you are crazy and cant get to sleep there are lots of good therapists out there who can help you with your anxiety': 341, 'hi california what youre experiencing is indeed anxiety its very common through research we know a lot of things about how to reduce anxiety ill get you started and its a great idea to connect with a therapist who can build on these ideas and get to know you wellits natural to have random thoughts that unsettle us our brains are complex wonderful things fearful and anxious thoughts are a part of this picture their purpose is to prepare us for the future and to help us make sense of the past and learn from it but what happens sometimes is that our alarm systems get out of whack and get set off too easily we often spend too much time worrying about things that happened or might happen when these thoughts take away from our enjoyment of life it becomes a problem so while fear and anxiety try to protect us they also seek power and will take any power they can getin general fear and anxiety try to tell us one or both of two things that something is wrong with us or that something bad will happen or that something bad will happen because theres something wrong with us they will use anything they can as evidence to convince you for example that person looked at you funny youre strange looking well there are dozens of possible explanations for the look on that persons face and its unlikely it had anything to do with you\\xa0for you personally your thoughts are about the afterlifeabout living forever what does fear tell you will be uncomfortable about living forever what would the worst part be a therapist would help you dig deep to find the core of what you fear it might be that you have no control over who you are or where you go it might be that you fear going to hell because youre bad search for that deepest feari invite you then to picture that thought as a glass of water on a shelf its a heavy glass and if you held it in your hands for a while and stared at it it would get in the way youd be uncomfortable and unable to focus on your life thats whats happening now i suggest that the problem is not so much the thought youre having we all have random silly thoughts that usually arent true the problem is how long youre holding it in your hand you could have that thought pick up that glass a hundred times a day and as long as you put it right back on the shelf its not a problem the trick is to get it back on that shelfright now youre using distraction to do this youre trying to focus on other things around you but i think the glass is still in your hand its not enough youre looking for more tools to get that glass back on the shelf \\xa0and the key is in your thoughts once you find out what fear is trying to tell you then you can talk back to fear so as an example if fear is saying to you you have no control over anything then you can work to accept the pieces you dont have control over learn to tolerate that feeling and claim back the pieces you can control you can control the extent to which you let fear take you over\\xa0with a therapist you can learn to refute fears ideas you can learn to look for concrete evidence of fears lies and gain back control over your thoughts i wish you the best': 342, 'good questions the paradox of thinking about forever is that you can become more motivated to live only in the present thinking about forever can certainly be overwhelming its a lot to think about what can you do about your future be present  learn and relax knowing that you are doing everything you can right here right now

surroundings is important in creating your sense of ease and balance no one can predict for sure what happens after death because consciousness transcends boundaries and limits we tend to impose on it

anxiety can help alleviate your thoughts and sense of fear and living the a life of kindness and balance will assure that your future will be happy for you regardless of the unknown': 344, 'religious questioning is a complex and often philosophical topic and these types of questions especially around heaven hell and an afterlife can bring up a host of difficult  confusing feelings what i want to focus on is the fear  anxiety you seem to be feeling that are deeply connected to your questions scary thoughts negative thoughts obsessive thoughts sometimes feel like theyre out of control and there is nothing we can do to stop them but i want to offer two techniques that might assist with your panic  anxiety\\xa0the first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them i also realize that might seem really hard to do but heres a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work thoughts arise in the mind all the time our brain is a thought machine many thoughts drift by like clouds and we dont pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way ie scary angry happy sad and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particular thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety so how do we work or stop those scary thought streams one new skill to implement comes from the work of rick hansen he wrote the book buddhas brain he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way the brain is like velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts there are reasons that our brain works this way but i dont have time to go into all of that in this response so its just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories \\xa0this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time if a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought\\xa0i would also suggest when youre having the thoughts about death take a moment to notice how youre breathing often when we are feeling anxiety we are doing shallowing chest breathing rather than taking in a full deep breath or what is called belly breathing if you take a moment to focus on your breathing and allow a couple of full breaths bringing in the breath so the belly rises and then the belly natural falls as you exhale just noticing the breath and practicing breathing can slow down the anxiety cycle as it begins': 345, 'you need to find an outlet someone to talk to your dad or someone who loves your mother as well is someone ideal but anyone could help just look to someone for help if you cant find anyone who you think will listen talk to your mom it can help greatly just to get the words out tell her how you feel about her passing but then also about everything else talk to her about your day

the certain things that your partner would be willing to do that and the ease your discomfort like staying with you for some time before and after sexual interactionsanother idea to consider is spending time with your partner and using nonsexual touch for each other perhaps first you to him and then him to you and communicating very clearly about what you like and do not like some people like to be spoken to during physical touch and other people do not all of this can be part of your discussions when you feel comfortable with that you could move into sexual touch in this manner and actually look at what you do and do not like you may also consider discussing things that are totally offlimits for you all the time and things for which you would like warning or awareness before

initially generally the idea is to learn more about each other and yourselves and then the process becomes much more naturalif the concern relates more to selfesteem related sex consider asking your partner to list several things that he or she likes about you even if you dont necessarily see yourself in the same light consider that this is how your partner sees you so these are some of the

necessary response to stressors and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming anxiety is our brains way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action\\xa0some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple the first id recommend is a calm breathing technique  breathe in for  seconds and then out for  seconds try to repeat this for  minutes another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe  without judging  the sensations to yourself try to be very specific such as my palms are feeling very sweaty and i can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad  just experiencing them as intentionally as possible \\xa0combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful\\xa0if you feel that these techniques dont help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to then id highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional this professional can help you determine if therapycounseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing

feelings they can be intense i will do my best to offer some suggestions or thoughts that i hope will be helpful to you there could be a number of things occurring therapy is a delicate private decision and i would first like to commend you for the fact that you are not giving up that you are working to figure this out and make this work it sounds like you are engaged and motivated to receive support from a professional\\xa0your continued \\xa0dedication and motivation will take you far i would first start by asking if you have discussed this with your therapist if you feel comfortable enough telling your therapist what is going on maybe inform the therapist that \\xa0that you feel nervous and shaky i am a firm believer in open communication between the client and therapist as this builds a healthy therapeutic relationship that yields positive outcomes if this can be obtained and well received this is\\xa0your time for healing and therapy should be a safe supportive environment to not only process but to seek support and guidance from a professional who can help you move past the barriers if you feel you are comfortable and able to speak to your therapist that would be my first suggestion is to tell he or she how you are feeling if they know then they can help determine the potential cause and allow you to process and move forward if this is left un resolved it will be hard for you to move forward if you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist i understand this is difficult if i may offer one more suggestion breathing exercises are very beneficial remind yourself what you are working to achieve close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips breathe in for approximately  seconds then let it out slowly be sure and do this when you are in private and feel safe environment when you begin i suggest putting your hand on your stomach over your belly button to feel yourself actually taking in those deep breaths i know it may sound kind of silly but they really work and are\\xa0incredibly helpful we often forget to breathe especially when we\\xa0 are feeling anxious you are supported here and try taking yourself through the above thought process and breathing and practice the breathing several times a day i hope this shaky and uneasy feeling eases wishing you the very bestlaura cassity lmsw

congratulations on taking that big first stressinducing step hopefully by now you are starting to feel a little more comfortable with your therapist it can be helpful to address this big elephant in the room and talk to your therapist about this i do my best to help people feel comfortable when they come to counseling but regardless of how hard we try sometimes it is just a little hard to get accustomed to the good news is the more you keep at it the more normal it will become': 369, 'if you have only been to a couple of sessions it makes sense that you might still feel apprehensive at first therapy is hard work you may be talking about some things that you never talked to anyone about before opening up to stranger can be scary after you feel comfortable with your counselor and trust has built up and you feel understood in session you should feel more relaxed i would encourage you to talk to your counselor about feeling a little shaky sharing what the process is like for you is important in your work if you still feel unsure about sharing after several sessions it is important to take a look at that and try to understand where that may be coming from for example are you and the therapist not a good fit but again if you are just starting out in working together feeling a little bit nervous makes perfect sense and i encourage you to give it a bit more time and to talk to your therapist about how you are feeling': 370, 'hi there\\xa0thank you for your question its absolutely ok to feel nervous going to therapy i have experienced anxiety going to see my own therapist there can be a few reasons why you might feel this way\\xa0first it is always unnerving to see a person who is a stranger and to share intimate things with that stranger you mentioned it has only been a couple of sessions your anxiety might subside as you continue to see your therapist and grow more comfortable with himher\\xa0another reason why you might feel particularly nervous is perhaps you are not comfortable sharing things as children we might have bad experiences opening up to others someone might bully or ridicule us and that experience can stay with us for a long time making it extra scary to share our intimate feelings and thoughts with others if this the case as you continue with your sessions and have positive interactions with your therapists this anxiety will subside with time and you will relearn that it is safe to share\\xa0and the last thought why you might feel the shakes is perhaps you know that you need to talk about some past experiences or memories that are uncomfortable and difficult\\xa0regardless of the reason it might help you to bring up your nervousness in your session and share how you feel with your therapist having an open dialogue about your anxiety with your therapist can help you resolve some of that anxiety and built greater trust with your therapist': 371, 'thank you for your question its completely normal and natural to feel nervous before a therapy session many people report having felt this way\\xa0i cant say enough regarding the amount of courage it takes to reach out and attend a therapy session for many people it can take weeks months or even years of contemplating whether to see a therapist or not before actually contacting one and attending the first session it takes courage to want to work through any struggles you may be having or personal growth you aspire toward\\xa0in your question you mentioned that youve gone several times and are still feeling nervous and shaky if you feel comfortable with your therapist and its a good fit for you i would suggest talking about this with your therapist you dont have to struggle each time you have your appointment together you and your therapist can work toward helping you have a different experience': 372, 'sure why notits nervewracking to go to a man or woman youve never met before and who is a total stranger that you are paying to take an interest in your life\\xa0 youre likely feeling an internal truth about the sessions the man or woman with you and the man or woman sitting across from you\\xa0 id listen to those feelingswouldnt it not be best to go to those around you that do provide comfort and aid first\\xa0 wouldnt it be better to attend to those of faith around you who have love to offer first\\xa0 wouldnt it be better to go to your family and loved ones first might try that see if your nervousness evaporates': 373, 'what you are experiencing is extremely normal opening up to someone you dont know from a can of paint can elicit some uncomfortable feelings and make you feel shaky with time and building trust with your therapist you will eventually start feeling less apprehensive before sessions consider bringing this up to your therapist as you both can process this experience together and figure out ways of coping with this anxiety before you come into the therapy room': 374, 'it’s very normal to be nervous going into therapy you are being vulnerable and honest which is always scary no matter how many times you do it the best part about therapy is that the more you go the more confident you are in your ability to work through those difficult feelings and while you still may sometimes get nervous you will have confidence too': 375, 'it depends on your definition of normal i would say that the average client i see feels some level of nervous energy when they come into their sessions and especially at the beginning i think that with clients who i work with that have difficult times in relationships maybe being able to trust people is tougher for them given their life experiences the expectation would be that they have a harder time moving through those nerves and feeling more at peace in sessionsin my opinion a competent therapist could help you explore where these nerves are actually coming from talking about yourself relating to another something else i encourage all of my clients to bring up whatever emotions are coming up for them in the moment as its helpful to the client to recognize the present moment emotion and then being able to process learn from and move through to a more peaceful place if that is what is being sought': 376, 'therapy can feel very weird to begin with  think about it how often do we go and tell a relative stranger our deepest darkest thoughts in the rest of our life so i think its reasonable to expect a certain level of nerves as you get used to your therapist and to the whole process of talking about yourself and vulnerable topics that said its definitely worth bringing to the attention of your therapist if you havent already to see if there is anything that they can do or that the two of you can explore together that might make the process feel less intimidating to you': 377, 'it takes a lot of courage to go to therapy\\xa0 i have gone myself as a counselor and know what that feeling is like this is normal but hopefully you have become more comfortable with your therapist this might be something to bring up to your therapist and openly discuss scary to do but its ok this may even relieve some of your anxiety\\xa0 if it continues you may want to consider trying another therapist as this one may not be the best fit for you': 378, 'therapy does not work overnight oftentimes it is a lifelong struggle the therapists job is not to cure you or to remove something but rather to make you strong enough to live your life with your own peculiarities and struggles remember we are human and constantly fallible another important thing to note is that although you go to therapy that is just a room most of the magic and work takes place in your real life outside of that room': 379, 'yes feeling nervous for the first few or several sessions of therapy is completely normaltherapy is an unusual way to have a conversation with someone \\xa0 the person is an expert in recognizing and understanding dynamics of human interactions \\xa0 for some people the fear is that the therapist knows more about you than you do yourselfin general terms hopefully your therapist has worked with many other people whove faced problems similar to yoursin this sense the therapist has a general idea of the basic dynamics you most likely are handlingno therapist could possibly know your particular details and your particular areas of upset or in what ways you feel unsure of yourselfonce you start to trust both your own right to tell your particular story and start to also feel that your therapist is listening attentively and cares what you tell the person your nervousness will start to disappear all on its owngood luck in getting the most from your therapy sessions': 380, 'it is absolutely normal to be nervous about therapy \\xa0many people take years to make the decision to start counseling and although it is a safe place to explore feelings it may be the first time you are facing certain issues \\xa0it takes courage to face issues head on \\xa0being nervous is part of the process \\xa0the fact that you are continuing to go to therapy sessions despite feeling nervous demonstrates your strength \\xa0keep it up': 381, 'yes it is completely normal to feel anxious about therapy therapy often explores topics and feelings that are uncomfortable the ultimate goal of therapy is to feel better but the process itself can be uncomfortable': 382, 'for some people its absolutely normal to feel nervous about coming to therapy \\xa0 its sometimes hard to share our emotions and feelings with someone  no matter how warm and caring the therapist is \\xa0 \\xa0 are you comfortable with your therapist \\xa0is it a good relational fit \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0maybe this is a good thing to discuss with your specific therapist at the beginning of your next session  maybe they can help you find some strategies or tools to make it easier': 383, 'well its generally okay to feel anxious or nervous about going into therapy particularly in the beginning because the process of being open about what you are going through much less to someone who you dont know well can be anxietyproducing its also common to feel anxious when you are discussing something that is important difficult to discuss or you are making changes that are very difficult for youthe most important thing i can tell you though is to discuss with your therapist this idea that you feel nervous and shaky some anxiety can actually help to motivate or lead you toward change there are also level of anxiety that can be counterproductive so its a good thing to discuss personally i can tell you that i would want my clients to tell me about anxiety they feel  of the time that opens the dialog to discuss whether it is the level of anxiety that they want to sit with and learn about in discovering more about themselves and their experiences andor whether they would like to do something to lessen the feeling of anxietythanks for writing here if it caused anxiety for you to do so i hope that feeling is diminishing for you at least related to writing here': 384, 'certainly': 385, 'of \\xa0i would love to know a little bit more about whats going on in your life but i will attempt an answeryes you could still be shaky and nervous going to therapy this therapy thing your doing is sometimes scary\\xa0first because your opening up things that you might have never wanted to\\xa0second your still building a relationship with this therapist person you may never get over that the therapist really cant be your friend they are there to push the buttons that you might not want pushed and help you heal \\xa0that in itself is scary and can make you anxious\\xa0third you really never know where this therapy thing will go yes there are goals but sometimes side roads need to be taken and sometimes that is scaryknow this you are in the right place you are taking steps to change': 386, 'it is absolutely a typical response\\xa0 many of my clients

an important encounter for you \\xa0my suggestion is to discuss this with your therapist let himher know how youre feeling especially if you feel as though your level of anxiety is impacting the quality and benefit of your sessions \\xa0you might try some relaxation techniques prior to starting the session deep breathing progressive relaxation core muscle disengagementif youre not familiar with these techniques ask your therapist or write back': 388, 'hello there\\xa0 you ask about being nervous and shaky walking in to your therapy session and want to know if its normal \\xa0 i realize there a few ways to look at this\\xa0 i presume you werent\\xa0anticipating feeling this way and probably hoped to feel the opposite\\xa0 well my initial response is yes sure it can be within reason to feel this way\\xa0 have you been in therapy before is this somewhat new that could be part of the reason but either way new or not i think when are entering into a meeting that holds potential evaluation of deep things about you and your heart and soul it can cause anyone to tremble the soul can be anticipating some things could be shaken up here and it can feel scary to look at these things and then change\\xa0 looking deep at our life can feel daunting and scary so your response just might be regards to potential growth trying to happen\\xa0\\xa0 or is there something about the therapist you dont feel confident about\\xa0 this too might be in play as a reason for your feelings\\xa0 maybe you lack confidence in that therapist \\xa0 have you let your therapist know how you

ourselves i would suggest talking openly in your sessions about this that way you can process your thoughts and feelings with the guidance of your counselor there are probably underlining emotions fears or insecurities that are being stirred up during your therapy sessions your counselor might suggest individual counseling depending on what you learn about your anxiety in individual therapy you would have time to deal with your own stressors as you address your issues then you will have tools and skills that will be useful in addressing the couple relationship': 391, 'i would be more concerned with how is this being addressed in therapy therapy can be a rewarding process however often times we do not pay much attention to the messages being sent to our bodies i believe in somatic therapy which deals with our mind  body connection i would think it may not be a question of normal or abnormal however if it is impacting you then you must pay attention to that it would be helpful to explore the feelings youre having \\xa0with your therapist it may be something that needs addressing to help alleviate those feelings or have a better understanding of why they are showing up when it is time for therapy': 392, 'it is totally normal  you have a lot riding on this and youre invested think about why you feel so shaky  is it something about the therapist or their style if so it

things because our brains tend to jump to that of course im not saying you are going deaf or anything just giving an example counseling can help you work through this anxiety it may also be helpful to reach out to a counselor to rule out if there may be other things going on sometimes things like paranoia can blend in with anxiety which is a very distressing experience but both are absolutely

conversation without triggering a sense of blame and subsequent defensiveness in our partners but it really is possible if you have any concerns about being able to do this then a session or two with a local counselor or therapist might be really helpful  and it really can be just about finding the way to share what youre feelingas far as coping with anxiety there are a lot of options but i highly recommend an app called selfhelp for anxiety management theres so much good information in this app to help you learn to pay attention to what kinds of thoughts are helpful or unhelpful and there are also lots of activities for calming down and decreasing the intensity of that anxiety the best part is its free': 403, 'in a way yes you have separation anxiety its normal in a relationship for us to slow down a bit with the attachment behaviours that establish and deepen love and connection so just because your boyfriend isnt talking as much or keeping you uptodate doesnt necessarily mean what you fear it meansthat hes forgotten about you or loves you less it could mean quite the oppositethat hes focused on being successful in his new job and impressing you he may think hes loving you more but you feel loved less you have two jobs to do here the first is to manage your anxiety by talking back to the thoughts it puts into your head it sounds like its normal to be insecure but i have tons of evidence that he loves me and that i mean the world to him find that evidence that helps you refute what anxiety is trying to claim the second part of your job is to let him know what you need you need more affection and connection during this period when hes away more texts phone calls information its okay to want that and i am sure he will be relieved to know exactly what he can do to help you feel secure and calm when hes away': 404, 'first step is to tell your boyfriend the reasons you feel upsetthis way he has a chance to answer your questions as to why he doesnt keep in touchhis

anxiety on a scale of  to  perhaps changes during the parts of his trips maybe there are certain parts that are more or less related to anxiety for you perhaps you have less anxiety while working or

it would be helpful for the two of you to meet with a therapist who specializes in couples to see what kind of relationship you want to have and what you can each do to contribute to that relationship there could be things that you could both start or stop doing to help your relationship move in the direction where you would like it to go as an example perhaps you would like a text before your

sometimes though there are emotions that have been waiting and waiting to finally find someone who will listen with a kind ear if you feel safe right away in the situation with your counselor you might just cry in spite of your fears about it your therapist is used to people expressing how they feel and will keep strict confidentiality so even though its embarrassing finally experiencing

therapist will honor this as part of your process': 436, 'yes if crying is how you are expressing an emotion then not only would it be normal but hopefully encouraged because its an important part of

your past that was very emotional for you at the time if it does consider working with a therapist to establish emotional safety before taking away the fear or anxiety that may actually be helpful to

behavioral conditioning that causes you to do this behavior during specific or perhaps even nonspecific circumstances do you think it is a selfsoothing behavior do you feel good after you have done it the behavior itself is likely causing some form of slow physical damage so i would recommend you have yourself checked by a doctor to rule out any injury if none exists this obviously doesnt excuse the behavior it just says that for the moment luck is on your sidewhen we do any behavior of any kind it is good to ask if what we are doing has merit or value is the behavior helping us to solve our problem or is it merely creating yet another problem by doing the behavior in the first place in the same way that a person might drink excessively because they are stressed and need to cope with some unresolved issue when they are done drinking the original problem will still likely be there but now they are intoxicated no closer to solving the issue when we deal with things like anxiety or depression we need to do things that work on dealing with the symptoms but also get to the root issue that created those feelings and find effective solutions so the things we do to cope with life events need to not be ones that cause us harm but rather support us as we move forward and work to deal with what life throws at ussometimes seeking support from a friend or a counselor is a good idea being given the opportunity to express your feelings about what is going on around you and getting feedback and insight from others is much more effective than actions of selfharm wouldnt you agree so

in performing things we were once able to do for example leaving the house presenting in front of others going to social events and having conversations with people however the more we expose

talk for a few minutes about some things that i would like to learn more aboutim just looking to learn more about what has been happening for you recently and im not trying to make you do anythingi know you said you quit your job because you didnt like it could you tell me more about what you liked and what you didnt likedo you see yourself doing the same kind of job in the futurewhat is it that makes you happy or what is it that you look forward to doingcan you think of anything that i can do to be of support to youif he is interested you may be able to connect him with an area community college to learn more about possible job opportunitieswith the way that i wrote the questions above it probably sounds like its relatively easy in reality it may not be an easy conversation and your son may choose not to discuss it with you if thats the case id remind yourself that you are trying to do everything you can': 642, 'you felt bad when you lied so you told the truth\\xa0 i imagine your mom was really shocked and upset  both of those things tell me you are a pretty honest person\\xa0 its possible that your mom had a big reaction simply because she has learned that her child from whom she always assumed honesty was capable of being dishonest\\xa0 thats not awesome but its not the end of the world\\xa0 you made a mistake  youll make more of those in your life just try not to make the same ones over and over againit sounds like you and your mom are close so i can see why it would feel so awful to have her distrust you\\xa0 since you are a fundamentally honest person the way back to being trusted is going to be simple but may take a little time\\xa0 the recipe is easy  say what you are doinggoing to do do only that unless change is necessary in which case you inform others involved and repeat\\xa0\\xa0and cut yourself some slack\\xa0 your mom will recover and so will you\\xa0 its an important and painful lesson about integrity but once learned it will serve you well': 643, 'it sounds like youve already learned that just being honest is often the best approach\\xa0what do you think about telling your mom how youre feeling \\xa0she might really appreciate it if you also let her know that regaining her trust is really important to you': 644, 'hey sounds like the part of you that knows the right thing to do won here i am so proud of you for admitting that you lied to your mom sometimes lies come out of our mouths before we can even catch them because we are trying to say what the other person wants to hear i bet that as you begin to show her that you are not going to lie any more she will begin to gain trust in you again be open with your feelings with you mom  she is there to support you guide you and love you give her lots of hugs  and give yourself one too for being so brave be wise': 645, 'that sounds awful and is clearly unsustainable\\xa0 there are some great answers that give some guidance about what might be an underlying condition\\xa0 if all physical and mental health issues are ruled out its time to take action\\xa0 get backup from friends or family members if you need to but let your daughter know you are giving her  days notice\\xa0 she needs to find another place to live within that time\\xa0 if she wants to stay with you be clear that first she has to go with a potential to return after she has been out for a good chunk of time\\xa0 once out she can prove to you and more importantly to herself that she is capable of maintaining her health and her environment\\xa0 remember you are going to rule out

you even feel frustrated about that but the only way you will reach her is if you approach it in a way she hears your concern and desire to help her\\xa0 be prepared with facts and places to go for help\\xa0 the better prepared you are the better the chances of her to act on it\\xa0 remind her how much you love her and how it is not healthy for her or for the relationship for this to

you feel any satisfaction in your mother daughter relationshipif she is of legal age and you dont want her to live with you \\xa0youve tried convincing her to get medical care for its own sake and to more clearly see her emotional and psychological health and she is unwilling to take care of herself you can discuss your options with the adult protective services agency in your statethe first step

any number of things but could potentially be a medical issue that needs attention thyroid issues autoimmune diseases  theres a ton of medical possibilities for her symptoms im not a doctor this is a forum of  i recommend the book codependent no more which may help you navigate your rocky relationship with your adult daughter you may be inadvertently making things worse by helping her which can instead enable her to continue her behaviors another book you may find helpful is boundaries where you end and i begin you cannot control another person especially an adult the only person you can control is yourself tough love is sometimes needed and she is an adult  treat her like one maybe then shell act like one if we were having this conversation in person you would interrupt me at this point with a but and then explain all the reasons why you cant tell her to move out get a job get up and cook or clean the house etc i already know that you have a myriad of excuses for things being the way they are yes i said excuses instead of reasons because thats what they are you may feel stuck and like you have to take care of her but you have choices  you just may not like them i know that when children are small parents lives are focused around them some more than others and decisions are made around what is best for your child but you said your daughter is an adult the relationship dynamics must change if the relationship is to be a healthy one i know how difficult it is to watch your child make life choices that you wouldnt want for them no matter what that choice may be as a parent we want to force them to do what we think is the right thing but trying to do that only results in frustrations for everyone involved whether the issue is a hair color a tattoo a lifestyle choice a job or choosing not to work or take care of their health or doing drugs or drinking  the choice is theirs and theirs alone and so are the consequences of those choices': 649, 'a lot depends on the age of your child but given that it was a misused debit card i am going to guess hes a teen\\xa0 assuming that there are a couple of important things to keep in \\xa0 that he lied about the misuse indicates he knows he was in the wrong\\xa0 thats a dreadful feeling  getting caught out and an impulsive lie may have popped out of his mouth before he thought it through after all a debit spend is pretty easy to track\\xa0\\xa0 once he lied he stuck with the lie\\xa0 \\xa0 somewhere along the line even though he knew that you knew he wasnt telling the truth he stuck with his story\\xa0 and as you said its not the first time he lied\\xa0 now it looks like a habit has formedgoing forward when there is a dishonest act of any kind its essential that you set it up so your son can be truthful\\xa0 simply put do not ask questions\\xa0 if you know for certain that he has for example misused your debit card say so\\xa0 asking did you invites him to get creative with denial asking why did you implies that with a good enough reason he might not be in hot water with you\\xa0 instead say what is\\xa0 i see this charge on my debit card and realize you used it without my permission\\xa0 you can only do this if you know for sure it was him but it sounds like you do\\xa0\\xa0if he meets with denial stay calm restate that you are aware this happened\\xa0 then deliver consequences that match the transgression he has to return the item if its returnable or find a way to pay you back for the charge as well as any fees incurred in using it\\xa0 make it harder to find your card because he isnt that great at curbing the impulse to use it yetand most importantly once the consequence is delivered you have to let it go\\xa0 continuing to bring it up wont benefit him but it does have the potential to make him more sneaky\\xa0 every time he asks respectfully to use it whether you allow him to or not be sure to praise him for asking nicely\\xa0 catch him doing it right as often as possiblehang in there  this isnt super unusual behavior but it isnt acceptable so address it but dont let yourself get too wound up about it': 650, 'hi enid you sound like a sensitive parent i like that you talked to your son to see if anything is wrong there is some key information here i dont know your sons age whether he spent any money whether he put the card back or how many times hes stolen and my answer might be different depending on those details but ill give you my thoughtsi see it as every childs job to figure out the rules and find where their power is in the world in order to accomplish that many of them test limits what can i get away with is a question they have to find the answer to if a child knows the rules theyre much more likely to not test limits because they already know the limits so part of testing limits is experimenting with stealing and lying not all kids steal but i would say pretty much every child lies at some point its a normal behaviour and most of the time its about small things that dont matter and we dont even find out\\xa0stealing a debit card is a bit more serious and im not surprised he lied about it if you absolutely know that he took it its okay to tell him that you believe he did this thing and also lied about it its appropriate to give a consequence for this type of behaviour so that the child doesnt do it again the consequence should be as natural and logical as possible the behaviour stealing was harmful to you so doing you a favour with extra chores might be a good idea\\xa0its funny because as parents we try to tell our kids that lying is bad but they know theyll get a consequence if they tell the truth so there are natural deterrents to being honest we dont want people to know our mistakes its a dilemma if you really want to focus on the lying part you can tell him that you wont give him a consequence for the lying if he decides to come clean with the truth within one day that gives him incentive to come to you with truth it sometimes works with kids to give them a chance to come clean and then reward them for telling the truth\\xa0you can set your child up for success and train them to tolerate honesty put a cookie on the counter tell your child to take the cookie at some point in the day then ask them later if they took the cookie youre making honesty fun kids love games\\xa0basically theres as much power in rewarding the positive behaviour as punishing the negative\\xa0if this is the first serious offence for your son dont make a big deal of it consequence him and see if he learns if its a pattern thats different and you may want the input of a therapist': 651, 'it is great that you are noticing these changes with your daughter i can’t offer advice without knowing much more about your

like to have over to play if a mom or dad can make the play dates happen or if they hit on an activity the child truly enjoys the young person may begin to forge friendships on their own\\xa0i

pay attention to how the childs social behavior changes over time such as social anxiety\\xa0the vast majority of children who define quality time as time alone are perfectly happy healthy and normal

daycare does he socialize in other situations or is it just at recess where this occurs if this is a global problem occurring at other social times it may be indicative of something deeper going on if

any contact with the parent you may want to speak with the parent first to determine whether they are in a stable enough place to allow this to happen \\xa0i would start by asking the child more about what is on his mind what does he want to get out of a visit with the parent is it to see them and know the parent is okay to get an apology to apologize for a perceived hurt to have regular contact to find out if they are loved what does he hope mom or dad might do or say in the visit there are many possible goals this child might have in mind this will give you a sense of whats missing for the child what need are they trying to fill once you know the need try to determine the likelihood of that need being met successfully through contactonce you determine the risk of the childs need not being met then you decide whether it makes sense \\xa0the older the child the more able they are to determine this with you or for themselves\\xa0there are other options than a facetoface he can write to his mom or dad text or email\\xa0its likely that the child is looking for a sense that he is loved wanted worth some effort when a child is separated from a parent they tend to blame themselves

ready to hear the truth of your relationship with their father but wait until they ask trust that they have their own experience of their dad and trust that he doesnt have the power to destroy their

fight for different reasons  wanting attention wanting respect feeling jealous wanting space and to be left alone or a whole bunch of other reasons regardless of the underlying motivations for fighting most conflicts result from misunderstandings and assumptions about the motivations of others and one of the best ways to start figuring out what is going on is to sit them down and have some conversations with them\\xa0these conversations should be centred on getting a better understanding of why they are angry with each other and really understanding them it is important that they each know that you are committed to understanding their experience rather than simply sitting them down and lecturing them about what they are doing wrong the more they are able to understand each other and feel understood the more likely they will be cooperative and considerate of each other\\xa0one exercise for doing this that can be very helpful is active listening where one person speaks and the other person reflects back what they heard the other person say and then checks for understanding this is hard to do but it often illuminates where the misunderstandings and assumptions are if this doesnt work it may be time to get a family therapist or counsellor involved who can help facilitate dialogue and resolve conflict': 717, 'your son is showing signs that hes just not ready to be toilet trained you dont say how old he is so im not sure whether the problem is deeper but right his fears may reflect that right now he is simply be not ready to take that step pushing him at this point

potential girlfriend': 724, 'hello and let me say first what a great question\\xa0there are so many people putting forth their  everyday and often times do not get the credit they deserve without being able to fully understand where youre question is coming from i think there are a couple of different ways to look at this questionfirst i think its important for us to consider the message being sent by those in your life stating that youre not good enough is that actually what they said or is this just what you heard sometimes because of our own selfdoubts and fears we skew and misinterpret the messages we receive from others again listen to the message being sent and attempt to remain objective is the message being sent coming from a place of love or concern if so have an honest and open communication with that individual about what your concerns are regarding the amount of energy and time youre spending on being good enough explore with them how you feel your already giving your bestif the person is unwilling to work at understanding this concern you have then it may be time to explore the relationship some relationships we engage in can be toxic especially if the other person is toxic it may be they have their own stuff going on and they feel the need to constantly put others down to make themselves feel better if youre in the direct path of this individual then it serves to reason you will probably be in the direct fire as well explore whether or not you want this relationship to continue in your life if its a relationship that must continue then work on what you will do to distance yourself from their toxicity or their problems until theyre willing to work on these issues for themselves then it may be necessary to find an exit strategy such as leaving the room or simply refusing to engage in the conversation\\xa0another perspective of this question is exploring the reason why its important for you to satisfy the expectations of these other individuals no one will ever be  good enough for everyone every single person has their own set of expectations in themselves and expectations in others it would be impossible to satisfy all of those expectations for every single person in our lives\\xa0the question becomes what is it within you that feels the need to meet these expectations there is most likely a part of you yourself as an individual that feels less than and feels as if you yourself are not good enough it then becomes impossible to every feel good enough for others because its really you youre trying to feel good enough for if you already feel as if youre doing everything you can do to be at your best version of yourself then really work on letting go of the rest no one is perfect and striving for perfection in our lives only creates more anxiety and stress find a middle ground in which you are happy with your accomplishments and your daily goals and learn to let go of whats left after all tomorrow is a new day and you can work on more of your goals tomorrowi recommend doing this by finding a mantra a statement or phrase you can repeat to yourself anytime you start to feel that sense of stress and pressure from striving for perfection the mantra can remind you to let go of this expectation you have for yourself or that others have for you so you can also let go of the stress and anxiety surrounding the expectation\\xa0i leave you with one of my favorite quotes that perhaps you can use as your mantra no one can make you feel inferior without your consent   eleanor roosevelt': 725, 'the feeling of never feeling good enough usually stems from our early relationship with our\\xa0parents or significant role models who made us to feel we were never good enough to meet their standards in the healing

that you are not alone we are bombarded by media and advertisements everyday that try to sell us things to make us somehow better thus leading us to believe that we are not enough unfortunately i believe that low self esteem is a social epidemicon a more personal level do you have any sense of what types of messages you have received in your life that have led to these self defeating thoughts for example did a parent or another loved one criticize you or put you down often were you bulled in school has a romantic partner emotionally abused you usually there are factors such as these which insidiously lead to low self esteem and self loathing once you can identify some of the factors that lead to your self hatred you can make a decision to not let these things from your past have such power over you any more you learn to take control of how you feel about yourself rather than letting others dictate that for you\\xa0i do think it is possible to heal from self hatred it doesnt happen over night and it takes time and effort it is about retraining your brain to focus on your strengths rather than on your weaknesses none of us are ever going to be perfect and if we look for a flaw we are bound to find one or two or three try keeping a self esteem journal every night write down three things that you were proud of that day about yourself try reciting positive affirmations every day

is quite painful and i can imagine that at times this pain doesnt feel like it will subside but it sounds like it is not all the time which means we can easily say that this hate myself experience is

those parts becauseit is the i hate myself part that is our inner critic and often our inner critic has developed a lot of strength throughout our life because of how weve depended on it for certain things sounds crazy but in actuality some of the most successful people in work mainly are those that have strong inner critics they use these critics to motivate themselves but with people and in relationships and in our relationship with ourselves it completely backfires because relationships are far more dynamic processes than doing well at workso try to acknowledge that the inner critic is one part of you that youve learned to give a lot of space to but if you sit with even a remotely positive feeling you have it can also be given the space to speak up and grow just like the critic has

up in an unstable home often grow up to be adults with insecurities and emotional problems the obvious such as being abused can certainly lead to a person having little to no confidence and self esteem but there are other situations that might surprise you to hear they can be damaging to a personyou may have never been physically or sexually abused but what about emotionally were you yelled at berated put down were you told youd never amount to anything were you compared to siblings and felt like you always fell short couldnt live up to expectations when you hear something over and over again you start to believe itmaybe you werent yelled at maybe it was the opposite studies show that children who grow up with a parent who is depressed show signs of emotional neglect a chronically depressed mother for example may have seemed cold detached emotionless she may have been less likely to show interest in a childs life not give praise for accomplishments or show support by going to ballgames or performances\\xa0if one of your family members were chronically ill while you were growing up chances are a lot of the attention went to them which could have led to your needs not being

has caused you to feel this way on your own a counselor can helpi am not saying blame it on your parents or telling you theres nothing you can do to change it quite the opposite understanding why you

be really anxietyproducing when you have not felt it before it may be helpful to work through some of this with a local therapist so you can get more specific ideassome other things that come to my mind are maybe talking about spending about  minutes or so discussing how you are feeling and seeing if your partner is willing to listen then you could ask questions about how she would react if you were doing something she did not like this allows you to react to information she is actually giving you rather than your perceptions that sound like they are different than what she is trying to tell you this gives you the power to receive the messages that she is sending to youi would also wonder where you have learned that there wasnt much good out there for you and how you can stay present in the moment when you are with your girlfriend and see that she wants to be there with you perhaps you could look at what makes you feel emotionally safe and trusting with her and focus on that you could even remind yourself okay im here with  and this is okay when im with herwe all have different levels of defenses in situations in which different people its common for people to see these things as black and white either totally open or very selfprotective in reality its much more like a rainbow and the different shades of color that are available in the rainbow spectrum of white light

with your girlfriend depending upon the location you are in the mood you are both in the subject etc there are infinite numbers of choices and you can experimentanother thing that could help is to communicate about communication if one of you uses a phrase that triggers something from earlier in your life or is really uncomfortable you could discuss that if she says certain things that make you

linchpin that heals all your pain but i can maybe give some thoughts and reflections first and foremost cut yourself some slack no one is perfect we fail more often than we succeed but in the end we learn and that learning helps us grow yes youre right the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good and need to stop you probably are doing more harm than good in that regard and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor seeing a therapist for yourself and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach you have issues that you need to resolve that while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life they are separate from your marriage in many respectsjoining a marriage support group can also be helpful you can find these through local counseling resources sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful if you belong to a religious or spiritual community then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for youlastly parents are imperfect yepits true they had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage we limp along and do our best having said that we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us the bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life both with ourselves and toward other people so this becomes a guiding principle in our actions it may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit \\xa0i am sure that remains to be seen but either way you both must be involved in saving it if only one of you cares then  of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person thats not fair so be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants and work to create an amicable solution

about things we cant change we know that it is possible to overcome embarrassment and selfblame but why does it seem so difficult to overcome it sometimes if you tune into your own thoughts or your

stupid now people saw things i did not want them to see if we tune in more we might notice we are thinking that this is terrible horrible and that we cannot deal with it these are selfsabotaging thoughts that lead to shame selfblame and embarrassment if you look at the evidence you can find more rational thoughts such as  we all make mistakes people can look all different ways at different time  this incident does not define me and if someone has a bad image or thought about me it is really ok people have all kinds of thoughts about other people and it does not have to be a major problem when you practice your rational thoughts often and replace the negative ones you will start to feel better more confident and your embarrassment will decrease quickly': 759, 'first of all congratulations to you on becoming a water safety instructoras far as how to forgive yourself this is probably one of the toughest things that we ask of ourselves no matter the subject on the other

maybe you can give yourself compassion for the idea that we all make mistakes and it certainly sounds like it wasnt intentional i think we have all had a swimsuit shift in unwanted directiontrying to make sure that the same thing doesnt happen again would probably be helpful but it sounds like you are already doing that something else you could do is think of something you can say to yourself when

this way is there anything in peoples words or behaviors that gives you this impression if your not sure it may be useful for you to try to notice what people say and do in response to you even though you perceive these attitudes within them additionally working with a competent therapist may be a great way to get an answer to your question as well as developing ways to move forward with that answer and gain a sense of selfesteem and security in your relationshipsone possibility that comes to mind of which there may be more is that as we grow up we often develop relational templates or sets of expectations about how people are and will relate to us which influence our experiences and behavior in relationships sometimes the templates that we develop to stay connected growing up are not particularly adaptive for adult life and can hamper our selfesteem and capacity for comfortable intimacy as an adult you ask a great question here and one that can be very hard to see through given the difficulty of feeling that people think of you in this way and i hope that you will stay curious about this and consider working with a therapist who is trained to help you discover the

have to pity her': 772, 'my first reaction to this is that it sounds like you rely alot on the impressions and projections of the outside world that you need validation from other people to compensate

podemos decidir enfocarnos en ello todo el día analizando en detalle porque lo dijeron y que hemos hecho para hacer que ellos piensen así eventualmente nos enfocamos tanto en ese pensamiento que terminamos creyendo que es verdad aun cuando originalmente no lo creíamos así¿entonces como lo arreglamos la clave es concientización\\xa0 es importante entender la manera en que internalizamos las

morning at the bus stop or really looking at the person who you buy your groceries from or thanking or complimenting someone for something that you notice and appreciate while this is not a substitute

you are lucky to have a loving compassionate partner and your boyfriend is lucky to have a partner who takes full responsibility for their actions\\xa0my hunch is that you learned some things about yourself when you were younger that are playing a role here your sense of worthlessness seems out of proportion to the mistakes you made you dont have to be perfect in order to deserve the love of a good man you only have to have the maturity to recognise when youve hurt someone and work hard to make it better who in your life overreacted to small mistakes you made were you shamed as a child did you learn that you deserved to be punished did something bad happen that you thought was your fault is there a mistake you made long ago that you need forgiveness for there is a younger person inside

deal breaker healthy relationships enhance personal growth and\\xa0 we enhance our spiritual and emotional wellbeing by collaborating with our partner to work through problems and overcome challenges my guess is that you would not be questioning whether or not to end your relationship if things were going smoothly are you both equally invested in finding a resolution to whatever is troubling youan excellent book on relationship ambivalence is too good to leave too bad to stay by mira kirshenbaum by the last chapter you will have the answers that you seek': 814, 'previous counselors have discussed very good points about your situation so i would like just to confirm what seems essential to me on this topic\\xa0when you ask yourself this question it shows you are not happy or have doubts about the way things have evolved so far relationships require time and work for them to develop grow and flourish as healthy and fulfilling ones for both partners this is a key factor reciprocity without both of you sharing the same core values beliefs expectations and lifestyles without you having a good level of compatibility in your personalities and feeling understood protected cared by supported and loved by each other there is no way you could truly feel and experience a mutually healthy meaningful and fulfilling relationship for the long run\\xa0what has attracted you to each other is good and meaningful enough to empower and support you for the long run many people focus too much on looks financial benefits or other external factors which are important but cannot build a healthy mature and fulfilling lifelong relationship this does not mean many couples do not willingly choose these types of relationship since truly believing those are their top priorities what they ignore is that with time life challenges issues and pain temptations and appealing alternatives around those external factors their relationships would not cope very well but would get gradually or suddenly undermined\\xa0be honest with yourself reflect on what you truly need want and expect from a boyfriend and life partner ask yourself if this person has what it takes to meet those expectations and satisfy those needs and if you are also a very good match for him since there is no way the relationship works unless it does for both of you so while one person could feel blessed by having such a wonderful partner the other could feel frustrated or just not truly fulfilled passionate or happy with herhis partner\\xa0longterm relationships require a lot and when i talk about sharing same core factors i mean truly feeling being a good match to each other at the physical mental emotional and spiritual levels and around all the other roles life\\xa0 involves related to lifestyle as social life habits dreams preferences etcthen there is a lot to reflect on by yourself to carefully evaluate in yourself based on what you already know about you and this person then you would be able to tell yourself if you truly want to continue or not with this person if you feel you do then you have to talk to him and make sure he feels the same way in a scenario where you doubt if you should tell him about this or that as another counselor suggested out of fear of any form of abuse or retaliation those would be serious enough to show you this could never truly work if your fears are more about being misunderstood and judged then you still have to work on developing open and honest communication with him as long as what you expect is something truly healthy and worthy\\xa0many people look for and stay in relationships because they prefer that to be alone by themselves thus they end using relationships to feel better about themselves and their lives to bring some feelings of happiness and company the problem is that if those are the initial core reasons to start or stay in a relationship this can never truly evolve into anything healthy and mutually fulfilling unless the person works on herselfhimself to meet those personal needs and resolve those personal issues which would enable her to work on self and with the other person in the relationship\\xa0finally i want to mention what i shared in a past article on this subject namely you need to assess if your boyfriend has been really consistent in his words and actions otherwise lack of honesty accountability andor respect would never lead to anything worthy in any type of relationships also we are all human beings and that means we are no perfect and we need to work on ourselves to make improvements relationships are a means to keep growing as individuals supporting each other to become better versions of ourselves without manipulation neglect or abuse thus while on one hand healthy love means embracing the whole persona with strengths and weaknesses on the other hand it is fully incompatible with tolerating andor enabling what is distorted or dysfunctional against that person or against ourselves this is why both persons need to be willing and ready to work on making changes and improvements as necessary without this it would be hopeless and helpless to expect things would be just fine with time they would not they would just get worse\\xa0so lets take one step at a time reflect on what you feel need and want now and for the future assess how well this person is able and willing to work on that and dialogue to make sure you are both fully aware understood and clear about your relationship and how well it could make your lives better if professional support is needed and both are willing to take it please do not delay it if one refuses necessary support then face reality and come to terms with what it is showing you trust more actions than words set and keep healthy boundaries and take into account what life experiences show you as well as feedback and counsel from those mature and truly caring people who know you while pushing away what is superficial biased or too rushedthank you for sharing': 815, 'deciding to end a relationship is a big question that deserves your full care and attention\\xa0 one of the first

beginning in a way that is calm not defensive and is honestly looking for an answer from your sister not looking to defend yourself at that moment if that conversation can happen it may be quite a difficult one so it may be good to have something to think of to remind yourself that you are trying to gather information from her and him that conversation its not about you but is about where she

explain her feelings to you while listening as an investigative reporter and asking questions that cannot be answered with yes or no but are what are called openended questions which ask her to provide more information during this process it would be helpful for you to try to think of it as not being personal but just listening and trying to understand the experience from her perspective

yourself up about potentially wasting all this time waiting for the other person to come around will not serve a positive purpose it likely will only lower your selfesteem there is a time to wait to

sometimes its helpful to compare what you are getting out of the relationship to what you want from a relationship its helpful to be honest about what we have given up for an unhealthy relationship

control you if you dont want contact from this person its really important to give him clear messages about boundaries dont contact me again and then ignore all of their communications any interactions or responses from you at all will feed their behaviour remind yourself why you dont want to be with them i hear you doing that already when you say he has nothing to offer me thats great selftalkbut lets get back to the question of why we have a hard time letting go of people like this sometimes its because we still hope they will change maybe we remember who they used to be or how they used to treat us and we think it can go back to the way it felt in those good old days the problem there is that over the first few years as intimacy grows people tend to show more of who they are not less so what theyre eventually showing you is who they are and what theyre capable of people do change and grow but it wont happen at your pace accept that person for who they are and stop expecting them to change\\xa0another reason we cant let go is because we picture our ex with someone new in the future and we wonder if they will be a better person for the next partner in their life this is a normal but not a healthy thought its as though we want them to stay maybe apologize and heal our hurts maybe make up for past mistakes you deserve that healing you deserve better than you got you deserve apologies but to expect that from the person who hurt you and hasnt demonstrated that compassion as yet is probably foolhardy\\xa0it is my belief that underlying some of the above scenarios is the deep belief that we must somehow be responsible for the hurts our exes have caused if you blame yourself in any way for someones poor treatment of you you will be dancing around trying to do things differently so that they can treat you better it will be impossible to let go because you blame yourself for their behavioursdraw a line their behaviours are about them not you and

extensive phone calls to a female friend viewing pornography a massage with happy ending physical intercourse or intimate emotional sharing depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities if there is no truth to it then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying i feel you distancing from me in other words its not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her often times accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness if so what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally if this is true you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again otherwise if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needs\\xa0the second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a sweetheart the term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean youre so sweet and kind my dear or in a flirtatious manner to mean sweetie the intention behind the use is known only to the speaker you may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife if your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said \\xa0if she finds the term disrespectful it may be her way of expressing i want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that i am not valued as much therefore arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark rather the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings you may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you is saying sweetheart to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife that said if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding accomodating and prioritizing her needs then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities she may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fearsthe last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting shes wrong indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong in the absence of her admitting to any faults it could seem like you are the one with the problem unfortunately blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy this pattern can also trigger the partners insecurity as they witnesses the distancing which could make them angrier and more accusatory  creating a vicious cycle finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment this kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding we sometimes take for granted the simple expression of im sorry however it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that in my practice when a client tells me that his or her partner never says im sorry i am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability if neither of them express it then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesnt do it these insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientating\\xa0for more information about these services you are welcome

not provide a comfortable environment for you related to this discussionjust a word of caution in my experience ideas of religion and spirituality can be lead to very deep discussions with some people who are very strongly connected to what they believe some people do not easily separate their own beliefs from those of others when initiating conversations about this try first asking whether someone would be comfortable discussing religion or spirituality a second question may be whether it is okay with this person you are talking to if you have different beliefs or opinionsas far as whether god

can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelingsbeing emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstoodmany people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions for example men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness therefore many men learned to turn feelings of sadness insecurities or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear instead it makes us learn how to express it in other incorrect ways if a man never learns to say “i am sad” or “that really hurt my feelings” and instead lashes out in anger then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstoodyou can control yourself and not explode walk away remove yourself from the situation do whatever you have to do to not lash out instead of reacting the way you normally would go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a “simple” thing upset you what is the real feeling driving these outbursts maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern\\xa0it might help

'hello and thank you for your question nervousness when doing something new especially something sexual that can feel so personal is very common indeed despite the fact that nervousness can be uncomfortable it is also part of the excitement of trying something new many people who engage in open polyamorous andor othertype relationships will tell you that difficult feelings such as jealousy and anger do show up sometimes this doesnt prove that there is something wrong with the relationship it just shows that you retain normal human emotions while in one and many people who are in polyamorous relationships have written about the work it sometimes takes to make such relationships work of course all relationships take work so polyamorous and other types of relationships are simply not an exception there could be several reasons why you are feeling the way you do one reason could be that you are simply not as comfortable with the idea as you think you are some time and good communication with your husband may help you with this another reason this may be bothering you is because on some level you are aware of the messages society gives us about marriages they are supposed to be monogamous heterosexual etc etc just because you may not agree with these beliefs doesnt mean that you havent been influenced by them we all have another reason this may be upsetting you is because it may feel a little frightening perhaps there are a lot of what ifs going on in your mind when you get the empty feeling it may be helpful to try to really nail down the emotions that are attached to that feeling one thing that i do think is very important is that you communicate these feelings to your husband it may even be a good idea to talk about expectations or ground rules if

nothing wrong with it if you or your husband would like to have sex more often i suggest talking with a counselor about this to find ways to engage in a sexual life in which you are both satisfied the aspect of connectedness is an important one while sex can be very connecting for many couples it isnt the only way to connect i find that communication about the matter of frequency of sex checking in

cheating on you right your partner needs to own his choices and if he is capable of doing it and is truly willing to work on the relationship with you to make it stronger more transparent and more fulfilling for both of you then there is hope the question is  are you willing to put in all this extra work forgiveness is not easy and it may take a lot of time and effort for you to consciously choose to trust again it wont just happen if you dont work on it and yes its unfair that you are being asked to work on this when he is the one who had been unfaithful even though it is hard you need to be able to let go at some point of having all the power in the relationship because right now you have it as the one who had been cheated on you cannot hold on to being the victim forever because it will create an imbalance in your relationship making it less healthy in the longrun all of this is hard work is he and this relationship worth it are you equally committed to making it work if so

incredibly difficult for couples to work through on their own': 1115, 'hello im sorry that this happened to you and that you are struggling with making a decision about this in my experience a couple

certain ways that both of you could learn more about yourselves and each other that may actually serve to make your relationship stronger sometimes there are motivations for having an affair that can be discussed in therapy in a way that you become more aware of what each other is experiencing and where you want to go from here it could be that learning to communicate differently would be helpfulregarding whether you should just move on i recommend talking about with a therapist as well at the very least you can discuss more about what you are thinking and feeling and what your choices are as far as where you want to go from here': 1120, 'its possible but challenging both partners need to be feel motivated enough to repair the relationship and dedicated to the work needed to address whatever underlying issues led to the serious breach of trust for some people cheating is an absolute deal breaker—for others the context of the cheating allows them to see it as a mistake that they can forgive their partner for so it depends on how you feel about the relationship and whether you want to put in the work to repair itif youre not sure how you feel counseling can help you resolve the ambiguity either individually or with your partner then depending on what you decide a counselor can help you either repair the relationship or decouple from your former partner': 1121, 'i think there are many different directions we could go as far as answering your question \\xa0i think the first and most important question you need to ask yourself is do you truly believe in your heart that you can forgive him and trust him again \\xa0once you answer that question honestly then you can move in one of two directions \\xa0first if you truly love this guy and see yourself being with him long term and for the long haul so to speakand you genuinely want to forgive him and trust him again that is completely doable and possible if you both put in the work \\xa0but theres a greater issue here that needs to be addressed \\xa0you say your relationship is good but theres been a sexual disconnect between the two of you and that usually indicates some type of emotional disconnect is at the core \\xa0would you agree with that or what are your thoughts \\xa0were you giving him less sexual attention than you normally do or were you guys never on the same page about sexual needs and having compatible sex drives \\xa0if you are more of an emotional person than he is you may have been less interested sexually because he hasnt been meeting your emotional needs \\xa0for instance if you hadnt been feeling loved cared about validated appreciated cherished and special to him than you may have felt less connected physically and been less interested \\xa0this is a common issue with couples and can easily be addressed if the communication in your relationship is strong and you can find a way to express to him your frustrations \\xa0in essence many women tend to have more emotional needs than men this is the way we are hardwired and there are exceptions to this of course but if you have been feeling neglected emotionally than your lack of interest in sex is actually completely understandable and normal \\xa0until he understands this and can learn to tune into your needs emotionally you may struggle with feeling you are out of sync emotionally and sexually \\xa0this leads to you both being frustrated but if all this is ringing true to you he seriously probably has no clue whats going on and may not know how youre feeling \\xa0you need to communicate your needs to him if you are super lost with how to do that theres an awesome book called the five love languages \\xa0its not that long and its very approachable and easy to apply the concepts to your relationships invaluable resource for relationships and truly eye opening reallythis is a long post im sorry \\xa0but this is such an important issue that is very common and many people feel lost about how to handle it \\xa0so back to the second direction you can goyou feel very betrayed you arent sure if you can ever trust him again and you see yourself perhaps being paranoid forever and never being able to completely get over this \\xa0for instance if he says he is working late or if he doesnt call or text right away when he usually does you may immediately jump to the worst case scenario that he is cheating again \\xa0of course it may not be true he may have legit reasons for his behaviors but the point is if you are going to be in paranoiamode or you just will always be unsure whether he loves you and is committed to you and only you then the trust may not be able to be rebuilt \\xa0you need to think long and hard about this and if you decide you have the capacity to forgive him and rebuild your foundation of trust and honesty then you need to let him know very explicitly what you need him to do to earn that trust back \\xa0you cant just tell him vaguely i need to trust you again if he wants his family back and hes willing to do the work you need to line out exactly what he needs to do and he needs to do it \\xa0but be prepared that he might throw out there that he cheated because he felt you werent attracted to him anymore or he tries to put the blame on you somehow because he says you werent meeting his physical needsif he throws that out there but you werent showing him the affection because you were frustrated emotionally then it all starts with you communicating that to him \\xa0get that bookin conclusion if you feel in your heart there is no way you will be able to trust him again and you will always wonder if hes cheating when his behavior isnt spot on you will be a nervous wreck and perhaps cutting your losses now would spare you the continued heartache \\xa0there is certainly a way to work through this but you both have to be motivated and you have to get to the source of why the cheating happened in the first place \\xa0rebuilding trust can be a long process maybe even years and for some people they may never be able to fully trust and let go of the past \\xa0i truly recommend starting with the book and then going from there \\xa0if you decide you want to stay with him you would really benefit from couples counseling as it sounds like a professional could help you strengthen your communication and ability to trust again': 1122, 'first off lets start with reallyvalidating the potential emotional pain you are feeling right now there isgenerally no lack of uncertainty anxiety fear sadness and anger these

who started speaking thinks the listening partner is understanding where they are coming from switch its also good to restate what you think you are hearing then you know what each other is truly following about this also remember that following or understanding what someone is saying does not imply agreement just that you are recognizing what they are saying and able to see where they are coming fromalso consider noticing what makes you feel valued special loved or appreciated think of the same for your girlfriend this could be a great discussion to have as well': 1129, 'your

helpful to anyone including himfrom what you write you did nothing wrong and your action toward the potential suicider was graciousmy only guess which is also very general about your ex bfs behavior

would like to talk about things that are important to youi see why you would want them to reach out i also wonder about how close he was with his friend and what he thought you meant when you asked him to reach out it sounds as if he is thinking that doing so would mean that he is responsible for his friends wellbeing although i cant say that for certainwould you be willing to have a discussion with your boyfriend where for a few minutes five minutes or so you ask him about what made him react that way during this time try to listen and ask questions is if you are an investigative reporter and are trying to learn more about his experience you can also summarize what you are hearing to make sure that you understand it as he does this does not mean that you have to agree with what you say but just that you follow i hear you saying that you think hes being selfish im suggesting that just during this conversation you ask questions to focus on what he is thinking and feeling in one

investigative reporter wouldsee if your boyfriend is able to capture the essence of what youre saying by summarizing it for youremember that hearing you and following what youre saying does not mean that he agreesalso consider if there are events in your past that are affecting the way you are looking at this relationship between your boyfriend and this other girl we all bring our own histories into relationships and we unconsciously expect that what has worked in other relationships will work in current onesthen you can switch so that you can hear more about what he is experiencing for example what it is that he likes about heralso consider having a discussion that if one of you becomes very emotional and needs a break from the discussion discuss having a timeout that will last for a certain time frame usually between  minutes and one hour and then come back to continue the discussionremember that the goal here is just to learn more about what each of you is going through not to

be to be seen as gay lesbian bisexual etc and i am not just talking about being unaccepted by others but a person may have a very hard time accepting themselves thinking about your values\\xa0and living a life based on them can bring a lot of freedom but i wont lie it can also bring a lot of pain at the same time for example someone with the value of living authentically may decide they have to tell others who they are and what they stand for even if that means people may disapprove that may cause a lot of pain but it may also come with a sense of freedom to live a life based on honesty and authenticity it may be helpful to find a counselor who is trained in affirmative therapy which is recommended for people who are navigating their sexual behaviors and figuring out what is right

some sort of timeout and setting a timeframe for something like i cannot talk about this now but we can talk about it in two hoursmy best guess is that your boyfriend is triggered by some previous relationship either romantic or in childhood if he is aware of something that he thinks or feels when you ask him to resolve conflict or to discuss it it would be good to know what that is it could even be that hes learned to handle conflict that waysomething else you could try is to have a conversation where you each discuss what is acceptable for what is acceptable for each of you during an

someone cant deal is reasonable as everyone can shut down from time to time but this feels extreme and is extremely hurtful to you i might even say to him that the behavior needs to stop if he ever wants to be in a healthy loving connected relationship because the amount that you describe him disconnecting severely hurts trust and security one of the first change events in emotionallyfocused

therapy hasnt helped its time for your wife to own whatever is blocking her and address it with her physician and therapist let her be in charge of the sex for a while to take the pressure off and she

have your data recorded read onthe first scenario is that you have been personally hurt in the past by someone else and youve developed fears that you will be hurt again or that youre not enough to keep someone interested this is just fearpeople cheat for their own reasons not because were not interesting this may be true if what you wrote down is they didnt really do anything wrongthere is no evidence im just scared and suspicious thats a cue to do some self reflection and calm yourself with thoughts like nothing has really happened i can trustif what you wrote down was vague evidence like for example your partner has been distant or irritable or youre having less sex than usual you can try to approach the situation without making assumptions trust your gut but your gut isnt seeing evidence of cheatingits evidence of something ask your partner whats up with accusations or assumptionsthe third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating maybe there are texts on a phone or someone has told you something they saw id say when there is some evidence its okay to present this to your partner and ask whats going on if this happens repeatedly and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that dont make sense then its okay to do a bit of research and be extra aware of whats going on around you\\xa0i hope that helps': 1247, 'i

details sometimes that is an image i just don’t want in my head about my partner vague details are usually enoughhowever i understand that your partner has the details and is not happy with your past this is a reflection on him not you this shows insecurities on his part you cannot control how he will react to information that you provide to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information the past should remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future if he cannot handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship you can offer couples

holidays or any special remembrance of your loved one but we do get to the place where we accept that death is part of life and that it is inevitable and that life goes ona therapist can help you explore the reasons for your extended grief and can help you with coping skills to better deal with it one suggestion i have is not to try to run from the sad feelings don’t try to not feel them

taking a look at the role alcohol has in your life it sounds like youre concerned about what happens when you drink too much and i suspect you already know the answer to your question about whether you have a problem or not i imagine you would like to stop feeling guilty and would like to avoid cheating on your boyfriend or other negative consequences and maybe have a fear of being or becoming an addict or alcoholic you might have a problem but that does not necessarily mean that you are an addict\\xa0i dont have information to know if addiction or dependence or other words would best describe where you are with drinking but it sounds like its begun to have some negatives so forgive me using words like addict dependence and so on i mean it more as a road map than a diagnosis the feedback im writing here is very general and doesnt address physical dependence and many other factors that might apply to your situation \\xa0one of the ways to think about substance misuse is to think of addiction as a disease of avoidance let me repeat that it is a disease of avoidance your ultimate task in living a balanced life is to figure out what youre avoiding and develop other ways to manage those feelings experiences and so on and of course along the way you may want to look at triggers situations biological vulnerability social pressures coping skills relapse prevention planning and so on depending on where you are in your drinking you might very well benefit from expertise and support\\xa0remember also that alcohol depresses our central nervous system and disinhibits us that means that alcohol is often a substance of choice to relax destress calm down etc also it allows feelings thoughts and behaviors that we usually inhibit to be expressed if you were unfaithful and often angry thats your first signpost for angry drinkers it is often true that you dont drink and then get angry you drink in order to express anger\\xa0i recommend you find someone you can speak frankly with who is knowledgeable about addiction wishing you the best health and wellness': 1301, 'the short answer is yes  if you feel really guilty after a night of drinking then you probably have a problem what you could do is visit this website by the national institutes of health\\xa0 \\xa0there you will find information on how many drinks is too much and the general answer for women is more than seven drinks in a week there is also a quiz you can take anonymously that will help you determine if your drinking is a problem the good news is that you can get help for substance abuse through counseling selfhelp programs or alcoholics anonymous': 1302, 'guilt is a narcissistic selfindulgent focus on me me me its best not to keep it in negative lightwhat does that mean\\xa0 well it stems from mankind having an animal nature and a spiritual naturein most societies today the animal nature is looked down upon seen as egregious and something to be put awayif i may say to you it is necessary and important if you wish to end an experience called guilt to not regard your animal nature as negative but to accept that you have it and acknowledge itthe more openly a man or woman acknowledges theyre animalside the quicker one may subdue ittry giving your animal nature a name and talk to it like a cute pet oh hey there snorky\\xa0 oh whats that\\xa0 you want to be a wealthy

you through this as you already made the first step in admitting you are having a difficult time': 1305, 'usually when someone asks if they have a problem they believe they do have a problemthe first step is to understand your own theory and definition as to what problem you feel you have \\xa0some possibilities are feeling unhappy in the relationship to your boyfriend not having enough discussion

with your dad or not and what other family members live in the household\\xa0something like this alcoholism is a whole family disease in other words family members often unknowingly contribute to the alcoholism and enable the alcoholic to continue the destructive behaviorfirst of all you can’t make your dad do anything and constantly nagging him or begging him to stop is just going to make him defensive and make this worse nobody can change another person what you can do is change how you react to him and the things that you and other family members do for him\\xa0research codependency there’s a great book called codependent no more there are a lot of articles on the internet that you can read in short you have to stop enabling him like i said you cannot control him but you can control yourself this means do not buy his alcohol do not make it easy for him to get don’t loan him the car keys or pay any household bills for him don’t call in sick to work for him or make excuses for him in any way do not bail him out of jail when he gets arrested he needs to be responsible for himself this may mean losing his job or losing his driver’s license this may mean that he loses his family if he doesn’t stop\\xa0what you and your family can do is set boundaries about what you will put up with it is his choice to drink but it is your choice to put up with the behaviors of his

him is stop doing things for him if you are a child who lives at home with him then this could be a case for child protective services in my state this is called dhs a report is made to this organization for child abuse or neglect substance abuse in the home qualifies of course alcohol is legal and when consumed in moderation there is no problems the problem will be the result of his alcohol consumption does he drive with children in the car while intoxicated is he left to care for minors while in an intoxicated state are there any domestic violence issues due to his drinking this

will be forced to stop when they were not ready \\xa0remember we can not ever make someone do something they do not want to do \\xa0there needs to be at least a little willingness on the other party

to do whats healthiest for your baby and yourself thats a great first step its also good that you are able to identify that its not always a physical need thats driving the addictionfor the next steps i would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur the psychological or mental cravings are usually based out of habit such as having a cigarette after a meal and if youre consciously trying to quit youll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel etc etc well if im on a diet and i continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer eventually ill give in and eat ityoure going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette thats normal and for the most part out of your control but you choose whether or not to continue thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought thats what you would have to work on changing when you have that initial thought acknowledge it ok i kind of want a cigarette now but then change the thoughts that typically follow distract yourself think about something else do something else whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigaretteive suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what theyre going to do when the time comes write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it eventually it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have itbest of luck and you have a really great motivator to quit  your baby': 1309, 'first off i would like to congratulate you on making the decision to stop smoking\\xa0 the next thing i want to share is that there are so many different ways to kick the habit some people find solace in groups while others prefer to see a counselor about this individually remember that the crux of addiction is feeling one way and using a substance or thing to feel a different way\\xa0 my suggestion is to find an addiction counselor and create an individualized plan together to help you stop smoking  your chances of stopping smoking are much higher when you have professional support and a plan to work on outside of your sessions': 1310, 'while smoking can be incredibly difficult to quit doing its not impossible so the first thing to not lose is hope and certainly planning to have a baby can be exactly the catalyst that one needs to motivate to complete this sort of task but as i said it still wont be easy even with the motivation therethere is a definite physical component but its great that you can acknowledge the psychological addiction that exists it would be helpful to dive into what that psychological need actually is as it can vary from person to person whereas the physical addiction doesnt as much and therefor can be helped through gums and patches and inhalers etc exploring and getting to the root of the psychological need can help you to determine what is going on for you psychologically and how else you can meet those needs of yours perhaps in much healthier and more adaptive ways that also help you to feel really good about yourself while replacement is not always advocated having psychological needs is not something to be ashamed of but rather nurtured': 1311, 'its very admirable that you are trying to stop smoking for the sake of your health and your childs health\\xa0 the mental aspect of quitting a drug can and usually is the hardest part\\xa0 first it can be helpful to change the focus of your thinking so you are focusing on the healthy behaviors you will startimprove rather than only focusing on the behavior that you are trying to stop\\xa0 the reason for this is that our brains hear the main topic of our thoughts\\xa0 that is when you tell yourself quit smoking quit smoking quit smoking your brain hears smoking smoking smoking\\xa0 so we need to put together a selfcare plan that addresses your thinking emotions and behaviors nutrition physical activity and other stress reducing activities\\xa0 the idea is to have an effective plan in place to both prevent yourself from feeling intense stress which increases cravings and to have a wellplaced plan for when the intense cravings inevitably present themselves\\xa0 and lastly and possibly the most important you have to believe you deserve to be the healthiest version of yourself\\xa0 think about the times when you are most vulnerable to smoke stressful situations after meals when drinking social situations etc\\xa0 the use of affirmations is also an important resource as what we say to ourselves effects our mood\\xa0 repeatedly telling yourself i am healthy i am getting healthier my lungs are becoming clear and healthy or other affirmations like this\\xa0 even if you dont believe them at first continue saying them\\xa0 this step is important to improve cognitive flexibility which trains your brain to be open to change\\xa0 think about activities that you like to do or that you would like to try and replace smoking with those

cigarettes\\xa0but you are gaining money health taste buds an increased sense of smell lung capacity a healthy baby etc \\xa0you could plan small rewards treats with the money you save from decreasing

also true that there is part that is sometimes a physical need and a part that is often connected to emotions in some way from the way that you wrote this it sounds like you may have been able to stop

that can very helpfulas far as the more emotional or mental piece these things come to mindsometimes a crucial part is looking at the habit of smoking and seeing what else you can do to keep your mind and hands busy there are sometimes toys like those available at office playground that may help to keep you physically occupiedthere can also be changes or additions to your routine because i imagine that smoking took up a great deal of your time maybe when you have the temptation to get up and go to have a cigarette you could have several other things that you can get up and do instead the list is endless but a few examples could be doing some physical exercise with the permission of your doctor just for a couple minutes because that could help with the craving as well completing a puzzle learning a new activity that requires using your hands painting or knitting perhapsanother piece of quitting smoking is often linked to anxiety or other emotional changes perhaps irritability depending on what it is that you may be feeling \\xa0learning other strategies to use can be helpful as wellthis can all be quite overwhelming and a very big life change i would recommend that if

be actively involved i had a patient patchedandreleased three times in spite of my advocacy and him literally begging\\xa0to remain and stop his voices we finally got a  day hospitalization because i strongarmed his psychiatrist into demanding that the hospital stabilize his patient \\xa0if your brother has a history of noncompliance with oral medications you can push the hospital for injection

could do something like that im assuming that you dont though there are steps family members can take through the court system to get someone involuntarily committed but it is a long process\\xa0i deal with situations like this everyday on the job the only time an adult can be committed against their will is if they are deemed by the doctor such as at an emergency room to be a threat to self or others for instance if he had suicidal thoughts and a plan to carry out the action or if he had homicidal thoughts against someone else and a plan to carry it out he could be placed on a short hold but these holds only last for a few days this still isnt a longterm solution\\xa0an adult has the right to refuse treatment and the right to make their own choices no matter how bad those choices are if you have a way to get him to an er whenever things like that happen such as being found sleeping outside in  degree weather it will help a lot they may or may not do a short term commitment for treatment based on the situation that brings him to the er but its a start they can help set him up with appointments for psych and he can get on medications you can help by taking him to appointments and making sure his medications get filled however you cant force him to take the meds so this may be something that happens a lot with enough of a paper trail of many er visits and that sort of thing youll stand a better chance of getting a court appointed psych ward stay\\xa0some tips about er visits dont send him alone always go with him or have someone go with him because you will be able to give the treatment team better insight into whats going on than he will he may say everythings fine and he wants to leave so they wont have any reason to keep him if that is the case go with him\\xa0if you do get power of attorney take the paperwork with you when you go to the er and to doctors appointments because they arent just going to take your word they need to see the actual paperwork having it on file in their system isnt good enough because paperwork expires etc take it with you at all times you can also compile his medical records and that sort of thing to take with you so they can see a full history of whats going onkeep in mind that if you do get power of attorney this makes you his guardian and you have to take care of him otherwise you can get reported for vulnerable adult abuse and neglect in fact your mom ignoring and not helping may already put her at risk of that because she is willingly doing nothing to help someone who clearly needs the help she wont be financially responsible for the hospital or doctor bills but should be held responsible for his safety someone should there are group homes for people with schizophrenia  being responsible for someone doesnt mean you have to pay their bills it just means you are going to make sure they get the care they need that care may be placement in a longterm care facility like a group home or a nursing home psych inpatient hospitals arent longterm so you do need to look into other longterm options psych inpatient stays are temporary and are to stabilize him theyre not where someone stays forevergood luck and keep up the good attitude work with his treatment team ask for a social worker if they see family that is wanting to do the right thing and wanting to help theyll help you even if

consistently stick to your new boundaries \\xa0that may mean not picking up your phone for each call \\xa0soon enough the message will be clear \\xa0good luck': 1364, 'i just want to understand before i answer who exactly is complaining': 1365, 'hello and thank you for your question i am very sorry that this was your experience with your family i truly wish i\\xa0could give you some things to say to them that would change their reaction but unfortunately i cant do that their acceptance of you\\xa0is a journey just like coming out is a journey for you sometimes families initially respond this way but after time they become more accepting and even supportive unfortunately there is no way to know for sure if that will happen so here are a few things i would suggestsurround yourself with people and things that remind you that you really are okay as you are that wont take the place of your familys acceptance and i wont even pretend that it would but it may help during those days when it hurts the most and that is really important patience is not something that many of us are really good at but this type of situation sometimes forces you to have some when families first learn something like this they may go through a period of shock and then sometimes even grieving they may even be worried if they are of a particular religion where being bisexual is forbidden these things can take time for them to reconcile so it may just take some patience if it is safe for you try to talk to them but if it becomes painful or hurtful then you have the right to walk away i do recommend setting up\\xa0some personal boundaries for yourself and perhaps learn some assertiveness skills if you feel you struggle with them the reason i feel that this is important is that people sometimes take a lot of abuse from family members and friends in times like youre describing they may want to be accepted so much that they put themselves in hurtful positions over and over again hoping that their families will come around they may or they may not and if they dont you deserve to live a life free of abuse and to feel confident and assured of who you are to be surrounded by folks who remind you of that\\xa0if you start\\xa0seeing this pattern and you are struggling chatting with\\xa0counselor may be a great idea i am bias probably but i think chatting with a counselor is always a good

and your identity if you are unable to receive support from your family you can lean on them if necessary if you feel your family needs more information you can always refer them to appropriate

and all that comes with that and perhaps other issues you might have with it it will be significantly easier for you to tolerate your familys lack of acceptance and perhaps chalk it up to a severe lack of openmindednessbut because it is family and we dont choose our families but are forced to deal with them for the most part for better or worse admittedly im not the biggest fan of outright estrangement processing the loss of the family that i hoped i had will also be important for you moving forward in your life you likely will be able to realize you dont need them to accept your sexual

her which would justify her indirect dislike for you then the best way for you is to find supportive and loving other people who will to some degree make up for the harshness you hear from heralso

some similar experiencesi was trying to include some links for you but that particular button isnt functioning window if you search for transgender support on google youll find glaad and pflag both of which are national organizations this does not mean that you have to identify as transgender but researching that term may help you to find both national and local resourcesas far as telling your dad if that is particularly concerning for you i suggest either talking through the details with a local therapist or considering if you have a trusted friend or family member one who will respect your privacy with regard to who you would like to know about what you are experiencing at this time so that you can talk with some people to have support this may help with two things allowing you to find some support for yourself as you work through the changes that you are going through now and also possibly talking with someone who knows your dad and may be able to talk with you regarding how or when to tell himone thing that i tell anyone who wants to discuss something that is very important to them is to ask the person they want to talk to whether this is a good time for an important

from you for example if he has been watching the news lately transgender rights is something that is being talked about a lot has he had an opinion this wont tell you for sure if he would be okay with learning you are transgender but at least you would know if there is hostility toward transgender people to tell you the truth the best way to tell your dad is whatever way feels right to you there is no right or wrong way best or worst if you want to tell him when you are by yourself with him thats perfect want to have a friend with you for support equally perfect whatever thing you need to do and of course there is always the option of not telling him anything until you are comfortable doing so unfortunately the response from your dad cant be predicted some parents are totally cool others not

you and how you talk to her you can let her know that you dont want to be told what to do or when to do it that doesnt work when youre  years old listen to what she wants too beyond the contract youve just written up anything else you want from each other is a request its optional and whether and when you do it is at your discretion my guess is that if she spoke to you with more respect youd be

what you are practicing and that you are learning these skills to be a better listener so you can understand him better then explain how it might be helpful if you both tried it if there is push back

is what he does specifically to make you feel that way be specific example when i get home and tell you about my day and you dont look away from the tv be objective as possible when you describe his behavior and the last part is the most important tell him what you want him to do and again be specific example i would rather you turn off the tv give me eye contact and reassure me about my day here

agreement this may be something that would be good to discuss with your husband – just because he is hearing what youre saying doesnt mean that hes agreeing with youlastly but importantly some people really dont know how to listen effectively there are people who just are not taught to do that until much later in their lives sometimes listening to someone can actually be very

1472, 'first of all my heart goes out to you infidelity is an extremely challenging obstacle to overcome there are some things that you should consider first of all did he seem truly remorseful if you felt in his heart that he was truly sorry for what he had done it will give you a piece of mind that it was a\\xa0 mistake\\xa0secondly was he forthcoming with this information how about with answering your questions after the truth was uncovered if you found that he was still lying or not forthcoming the sting is even more painful he should be able to answer any question you have honestly and without hesitationthirdly has he shown a positive difference after this experience at this time he should still be proving his faithfulness to the marriage you and the childrenkeep in mind that experiencing infidelity is a form of grief it is not a quick process that can easily be overcome what you are experiencing is  normal\\xa0my best suggestion would be to see a marriage therapist find out what drove your husband to cheat in the first place and decide if this aspect in his life has been resolved i know its important for you to keep your family together but children can sense anger and frustration this is not a healthy environment either if you decide that you can no longer remain in the relationship a therapist will also be able to help you cope with the separation along with addressing your childrens needsplease know that you are not alone and that unfortunately many relationships have endured this very thing it may also be helpful to reach out to people who have experienced similar obstacles the web is a great resource to find groups whether online or in person to use as a support or sounding boardbest of luck to you and your family': 1473, 'to begin im sorry to hear about your situation like many of the professionals have stated infidelity is a very difficult obstacle to move forward from its not impossible while forgetting is probably the hardest part forgiveness is something that can and will happen there are things you can do to help yourself\\xa0the first this is identifying what you feel is best for yourself and your children that means being honest with how you feel being in this relationship on a daily basis and understanding how its affecting you\\xa0second how is your relationship affecting the children do you feel that by staying in the relationship\\xa0that its affecting your daily interaction with them if so that something to keep in mind\\xa0next really looking at the pros and cons of staying in the relationship a specific breakdown of what benefits come with staying and what are the ramifications viceversa for leaving include your partner i think being honest with him and letting him know what you are thinking is could be a great option at least you arent keeping something inside yourself to manage rather you are being transparent to them sometimes a couple can come to an agreement that it may be time to end things and other times it may be best to keep moving forward with a serious plan to how to move forward regardless if you cant trust him and that feeling will never go away its time to address it couple

betrayal and id like to echo the sentiment of danielle alvarez infidelity takes time to heal from so allow yourself to grieve and find the support you need id highly suggest going to couples therapy and addressing all the issues that danielle raised especially whether he has expressed genuine remorse and is being completely transparent with you and is taking responsibility for the choice he made including acknowledging the immense impact it had on you your relationship and your ability to trust him\\xa0if you have doubts about being able to trust him he needs to be willing to earn back your trust and do whatever it takes to do so if he accepts this challenge then that is a good sign you are on the path toward healing your relationship also please dont ever forget that regardless of what led him to cheat it was his decision to take that action rather than addressing whatever issues he was having in your relationship couples affected by betrayal typically have some underlying issues whether it is a lack of connection or intimacy or another factor and it is possible to heal and grow even stronger as a couple after betrayal because you are grieving though allow yourself to acknowledge and accept your feelings of hurt and pain as they will likely come in waves but the pain will lessen over time and with supportive therapy along with the commitment to repair your relationshipfrom both you and your husband\\xa0also in regards to your concern about hurting your children keep in mind that parents model healthy relationship behavior for their children if your relationship with your husband remains disconnected untrusting or bitter your children will see that and not only feel sad that their parents are both suffering but also grow up feeling that experiencing such ongoing pain is tolerable or even normal in a relationship having parents who learn to handle conflict or heal deep wounds in healthy ways is crucial for childrens emotional and psychological development whether they see you heal together as a married couple or heal separately as loving but divorced coparents they will learn what it is like to expect healthy communication and boundaries in relationships which im sure you want for your children take care of yourself and i wish you much peace and healing\\xa0also here is a good book i would recommend along with books by gottman as rebecca wong suggestedprivate lies infidelity and the betrayal of intimacy': 1475, 'lets just start with acknowledging that trust is huge and betrayal hurts youre entitled to your feelings all of them and you need to know that your husband understands you that said some ways are more effective at rebuilding and repairing relationships that others i am a big fan of the gottman method for

necessarily mean however that your husband is gay bisexual transgender or even necessarily a crossdresser etc unless he has already told you so i agree with the other poster who recommended you try and ask him more questions with an open and curious attitude and see if he might be open to explaining more with you\\xa0that being said what we also know from research is that frequently what turns us on isnt always what we identify as \\xa0lots of people have fantasies or even sexual behaviors they may enjoy from time to time without considering themselves to be a part of any label or subculture for example many women are okay with having their hair pulled or bottom spanked during a particular rowdy sexual encounter but certainly dont consider themselves kinky submissive or anything else \\xa0it could be that your husband enjoys pretending fantasizing that he is something completely different in the bedroom from time to time from what most other see him as outside in the corporate world or in other roles he plays as husband father son friend etc \\xa0many of my kink clients are drawn to their particular fetish simply because its the opposite of what their life typically entails eg a high profile ceo who is always responsible for making the decisions enjoys being at the mercy of someone else once a week\\xa0each of us has a sexual script  a blueprint if you will of what we like and dont like in the bedroom and also what we have each come to see as being normal \\xa0its also an internal guideline for how we each define our role in sexual expression sexual

couple is able to successfully navigate formulating a plan for both to feel validated and sexually satisfied the relationship thrives\\xa0most counselors would agree that a healthy script includesboth partners taking ownership for the couples sexual experiencesboth partners learning to communicate openly and honestly about their feelingsboth partners learning to meet one anothers  needs desires and

how both of you will come to an agreement about fulfilling these desires in a way that doesnt hurt either one of you or the marriagemy warmest wishes to you both': 1477, 'it sounds like you may be asking two different questionswith regard to what you said about your husband dressing as a female in your bedroom i wonder if you would consider asking him more about this if you choose to do that i would suggest that you ask him whether a certain time is a good time to have a conversation and asking questions for five minutes or more that are related to you learning more about his experience this can be difficult to do at times particularly when you may want to offer your own opinions or become very anxious or of type consider thinking of a phrase that may help you to stay calm during the discussion it may be helpful to think of yourself as asking questions as if you were an investigative reporter and using questions that start with words like what how who where when questions that start with why can be very difficult to answer for some people and can be overwhelming because it often links to answers involving emotions that may or may not be understood\\xa0also try restating what your husband is saying to make sure that you are understanding correctly if what he is telling you is different than what you have heard or thought of for many years it may be challenging to follow his meaning initially remember that listening to your husband does not imply agreement with what he is saying just that you are following and looking to understand what he is experiencing i also recommend sticking to one topic for the conversation but this could be done with many different topics over timeyou could also see if he would be willing to have a discussion where he listens like an investigative reporter to learn more about the experience that you are havingas far as what you mentioned about the sexual experience maybe if you can discuss what it is that you dont like andor understand what it is that he does like you could see if there is some middle ground here it depends on what you both preferthese types of conversations can be difficult to have for some couples at least initially having structured conversations such as the ones ive described briefly above can feel awkward initially but the reason it can be helpful is because it can lead to further understanding in a way that decreases the chances of having an argumentalso consider seeing a therapist in your area who specializes in couples to discuss some of these ideas': 1478, 'what you are describing is a state of abandonment like no other a direct lack of respect the challenge here is you cannot control another person no matter how hard you try the only person that you have control of is yourself so then the question that this reality poses is what are you willing to change if you love yourself and know that you have tremendous value if you can see what you bring to a relationship and that you deserve respect and love and tenderness then you will get to a point where you will settle for nothing less than that the change that might be necessary in yourself is to change the way you see yourself the way you treat yourself and what you accept your husband also needs to change and that is something only he can do for himself but reaching out to get help as well it would be helpful for you both to get help because there is damage on both parts you have much more power than you realize and talking with someone can help you to hone that power and make a difference in your own life sometimes the differencechange can be walking away from a bad situation or it can simply be changing your attitude and raising the bar sometimes our loved ones come with us on the elevation

because we have that connection established we instinctively cut back on those loving behaviours because we dont have to work hard to earn their love anymore that sparkly feeling typically lasts a few

eating meaning you need to attempt to eat normally eating appropriately portioned meals  times a day with snacks in between if you binge then it may be helpful to remind yourself that when you attempt to compensate for your bingeing behaviors and you end up feeling restricted from over exercising or undereating then this actually leads to a binge again thus reverting you back to the cycle if you binge it will be helpful to try and get back on a normal schedule of eating instead of trying to compensate for the binge although it may feel counterproductive getting back on a normal eating schedule will prevent you from entering into the restrictive cycle\\xa0it can also be helpful to remind yourself that the binge has already occurred it is in the past and the goal is to move forward without focusing on the past focus on what you can do differently next time what emotions or situations led up to the binge what can you to do prevent or change the circumstances that led to the binge

and yes sometimes reserved for special occasions and celebrations but in many cultures we place a lot of emphasis on food we have food at every gathering and every celebration whats more people have come to almost expect food to be present at any and every gettogether and if its not well then forget about it\\xa0i see this time and time again with my clients donuts appear in the office and its almost like donuts have never been there before must eat one or two\\xa0however we need to remind ourselves that this occurrence or similar ones will not be the last time we can enjoy this particular food it is likely the office donuts have happened before and they will be there again on another day during these moments i like to have my clients employ a stopandthink method stopandthink about your goals before you eat is this donut getting you where you want to be also i have my clients ask themselves how special is this donut if the donut really is a special donut from the best bakery in town and youve never been there before then now might be a time to have the donut but if not it would be wise to pass and wait until that special donut\\xa0another aspect we need to remember about food is to think about what were getting from overindulging or overeating are you trying to drown out other emotions are you trying to feel better and the food gives you that feeling for a brief moment what else is going on this can be determined by utilizing what we describe as a thought record a thought record involves tracking and identifying thoughts and feelings associated with food triggers by targeting the emotions we can then determine where theyre coming from as well as how to decipher them a therapist can also help you with understanding your emotions related to food and will be helpful in assisting you with the thought recordthe most important thing to remember is that food addiction can be a real problem for a lot of people if food is taking over your life and you are preoccupied

right trackas far as learning how to listen try some of these stepsask whether a certain time is a good time for your girlfriend to have an important conversationif she has a subject that she would like to discuss consider listening to her as an investigative reporter and asking questions that help you to gain more understanding of her experience these questions usually begin with words like who what where when questions starting with the word why can sometimes make people very uncomfortable because they may not explicitly know why they are asking for something or feeling a certain way you can try communicating this way for just five minutes or so on until you feel as though you can restate what your girlfriend is saying and have her agree that you are recapturing the essence of what she is trying to communicatethen you can switch so she is listening to you trying to understand your experience you could also start by talking about something that is important to youremember that stating that you follow or hear something that she is saying doesnt mean that you agreealso try sticking to one subject at a time its difficult to really understand one topic if you are on to the next within just a minute or twotry to use the word want or wish instead of need saying that you need something or if your girlfriend would say that that is not a need for safety or something like that can make whatever you are asking for sound like an obligation that takes away from that whole motivation to change from inside the partner who is agreeing to change or try to changesomething else to try would be using some sort of timeout consider thisdiscuss the idea of using timeout before you actually need it and before the discussion starts timeout is a way to give each of you a way to calm down for five   minutes or maybe even an hour when there are a lot of emotions happening each person gets wrapped up in protecting themselves from the emotions they are feeling and can lose track of what is actually going on in the conversation as compared to what they are perceivingwhen using timeout say to your girlfriend or she can say to you i need an hour before we can go back to this then actually come back to the discussionsome people are very afraid to use this technique because in the past not talking about something right away meant that it never was returned to and was never resolved in any way this is why the agreement is important before you need itwhile it may be helpful to ask your girlfriend what it is she may want from you it is you that would be in charge of deciding whether you want to make that change and putting it into practicetry to remember that part of being in a couple is holding onto your own wants wishes and desires while recognizing those of

that he cares about your feelings and values your importance if he responds in a defensive manner it could mean that he does not like that you are questioning your trust in him or that he has something to hide either way you may wish to explain that building trust is something that is very important to you in a relationship and that talking to him openly helps to foster that if he continues to be defensive or evasive then there might be some bigger issues at stake and the two of you may benefit from couples counselling or having a discussion about the values that are important

you are but if youre an adult after two and a half years i dont think its unreasonable to have an open and honest talk with each other about where the relationship is going and what you both want and expect long distance relationships are difficult to keep alive because you dont ever see each other in person talking texting and video chatting isnt enough and the longer the physical distance remains the more difficult it becomes to keep an emotional closeness it may be time to evaluate the situation figure out when if ever the two of you will be able to be together in person and if you can and want to wait that long do you both want the same things out of life if one of you wants to take the relationship to the next level but the other doesnt then it doesnt matter if its long

each other being afraid to speak up and have an honest conversation  these things can ruin relationships if not addressed i know confrontation of any sort can be hard for some people but it is necessary at times evaluate your true feelings for him are you with him for reasons other than love such as being afraid to be alone or thinking you wouldnt be able to find someone else has he ever given you reason to be suspicious of his female coworkers or friends before some people unfortunately develop a track record of indiscretions and give their significant others ample reason for distrusting them however if this is not the case you may be unfairly judging his texting through the eyes of your own insecurities\\xa0it may be time for you both to take an honest assessment of your own reasons for being in the relationship figure out what you want and make a decision this may result in bringing the two of you closer and taking the relationship to the next level or it could lead

not based on evidence knowing that distinction is important because if it is the latter you may benefit from refocusing on the wonderful qualities about your partner that makes you feel good about him

make you act in ways that are insecure\\xa0however if there is reason for you to question his fidelity you may have to speak to your boyfriend about how to build trust in the context of a longdistance relationship to help the conversation you may need to consider what you may need to experience or receive as support to feel safe in the relationship to build trust is that you wish him to contact you regularly or to include you more in his life or to make a clear commitment for many of my clients in my private practice that may include talking to their partner often and using a variety of modalities including text phone and skype its hard to believe in a relationship when you never talk to your partner and its hard to build a relationship when you dont know whats going on in your partners life other times it is making sure they talk often to their longdistance partner so that they can participate in each others lives and to feel their presence regular communication

of the distance you could type something in the top of the message about not reading any further if the person who is reading doesnt have  minutes or something like thattry to listen as though you are an investigative reporter trying to find out information about each other asking more questions in this manner can be a helpful way to be less defensive during difficult or emotional conversationswhen having discussions facetoface i often recommend using timeout when things become very emotional and saying that you agree to go back to the conversation in  minutes or one hour or some short duration of time that allows for some of the immediate emotions to dissipate so it is easier to also talk about them as for how that translates to distance maybe each of you would say that you are working on

significant training in counseling as well as assisting with marriage and couples counseling these services are ordinarily offered free of charge to membersanother option might be to explore support

theme for her like you are saying it is for you\\xa0 however she had been doing a lot of work on her own and in private therapy and this was a new relationship\\xa0 obviously she still had not “gotten it right” because she did once again attract a man with these tendencies\\xa0 the difference this time was that she had done a lot of work on herself and had become a stronger person\\xa0 when she looked at him in our session and said to him “i don’t need you i want you\\xa0 but not if you are going to continue to act like this\\xa0 so you leave the house and don’t come back until you are ready

decision\\xa0first and foremost you must ask yourself if you ever loved your sons’ father or was it a situation to where you two got pregnant and stayed together for the child it’s very common to stay with your partner when a child is involved regardless if love is involved or not because “it’s the right thing to do” right well not entirely although staying with your partner because you have a child together may seem right in fact it hurts the child in the long run if you are not love with your partner you will show distance unhappiness sadness possibility of frequent arguments and cheating when a child grows up in the home and witnesses these types of emotions  behaviors it is unhealthy as heshe will expect their own relationships to be such as a responsible adult you are supposed to be there to shape and model the future for your child just remember what you do your child will model\\xa0secondly do not sell yourself short from love everyone deserves to be happy and to have someone to share their love and intimacy with however being in love with someone you have never seen before can be very risky honestly that sounds like lust and the longing of love humans have needs and when people are unhappy in their current relationship they often seek out what they need if you decide to pursue the second relationship i would suggest setting up an outing with a friend or two in order to get to know this person as there are a lot of scammers these days\\xa0finally i am not convinced that this has anything to do with choosing between two guys this seems as if you are making a decision to end the relationship with your child’s father or not you should ask yourself if you were in love with your child’s father first off if you were you would have never sought after love i

yours i agree you need to talk to someone the fact that you’ve put up with his repeated cheating and then letting him blame you for it by saying youre not affectionate enough etc tells me you probably have low selfesteem and have likely told yourself over the years that you dont deserve any better you do you may truly love this guy but based on his behaviors he does not love you not in the way you deserve \\xa0and although you may want to believe he can change he has proved over and over again that hes not willing to so you need to do what is best for you and your children what would you tell your daughters if someone was treating them this way would you want your sons to treat women this way thats what youre teaching your children when they see thislike i said i agree that you should talk to someone you can ask your boyfriend to go too but my guess is he wont even if he does you should still see someone individually to work on you i understand its not easy to just kick him out

troubles i see a few issues here i wonder why you were both trying to get pregnant when the relationship seemed troubled some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant and all this does is bring up more problemsyou say you never treated her badly and i believe you people in a relationship can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on in fact giving too much of yourself to the relationship and not having a “self” outside of this relationship can be unhealthy it takes two whole healthy happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole healthy happy couple in a relationship expecting your partner to meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to workthere are two books that i recommend you buy and read one is codependent no more the other is can my relationship be savedsometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone it makes you both miserable you cannot change her and cannot change her mind sometimes the best thing is to let go if it is meant to be you will end up back together again it seems like this is something that she needs to decide since she is the one that keeps doing the leaving i suggest backing off and letting her go maybe she needs time to clear her head and make up her mind if it is meant to be she will come back if not use this

that spectrum as you say but i dont really know or maybe as you move through life you just wont identify as any one thing and thats totally okay the most important thing in my professional opinion is to accept yourself fully for whatever it is that you are the second most important thing in my professional opinion too is to be honest with yourself and your partners about however you do identify your sexual orientation': 1688, 'sexual orientation is not always something that is clearly definable some people look at it on a continuum where being attracted to only boys is at one end only girls

people dont know for quite some time in addition to that after people do know who they are attracted to a lot of times they do not use the terms gay or bisexual for quite a whileits okay not to

suggest it would be important to become comfortable with how you feel yourself and possibly tell some people whom you really trust first also consider that once you tell someone something its not possible to undo it so if you tell someone they may tell someone else then there is also the matter of people having very different reactions related to different genders and not everyone will be

may help to think about what qualities you find attractive what kind of person can you see yourself being attracted to someone smart funny loves dogs if you look for these qualities in a person they may lead you to being attracted to someone of the same sex but maybe not at least you would be choosing someone based on values and qualities that you love and admire another idea is to chat with a

that people who are asexual have absolutely no interest in sex and that is not always the case there are variations of asexuality some people who are asexual have an interest in sex and others dont

are like you and have your back  i am not sure where you live but there are counselors who specialize in affirmative therapy which is what is recommended for folks who are part of the lgbtq community

counselor before agreeing to see them for counseling an ethical counselor would have no problem answering them before having you come in  if there are some lgbtq resource centers in your area try to reach out to them and see if there are support groups gaining more support from others would be helpful sometimes lgbtqfriendly counselors leave their contact information for people in resource

with these types of thoughts the first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them i also realize that might seem really hard to do but heres a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work thoughts arise in the mind all the time our brain is a thought machine many thoughts drift by like clouds and we dont pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way ie scary angry happy sad and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particulate thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety so how do we work or stop those scary thought streams one new skill to implement comes from the work of rick hansen he wrote the book buddhas brain he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way the brain is like velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts there are reasons that our brain works this way but i dont have time to go into all of that in this response so its just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories \\xa0this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time if a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought': 1740, 'there are some great thoughts offered by others here\\xa0i would just add that typically the most natural response to fearful thoughts is to want to stop avoid or get rid of them  which doesnt work if youre really caught up in a cycle of ocd or other form of anxiety\\xa0in the long run the more effective thing to do is the harder and less intuitive option to have those uncomfortable thoughts on purpose\\xa0this may mean writing out in detail what the worst case fear you are thinking of is and then reading it over and over again until it becomes boring it may also mean pausing through the course of the day to merely observe all the thoughts going on and realizing that thoughts are merely thoughts they are not the same as reality and the unpleasant ones can become a lot less scary when we realize we can coexist with them without them coming true': 1741, 'such a great question im so sorry you are struggling you may be experiencing intrusive thoughts \\xa0these are thoughts that seem to come from no where and victimize us \\xa0i can strongly recommend a book called when panic attacks by dr david burns \\xa0it helps you to identify the thoughts and the help you create ways to counteract them \\xa0there is another technique called thought stopping thought stopping can be as simple as saying stop loudly if you are alone or in your head if you are in public \\xa0its a quick way to distract you from the distressing thought and allow you to refocus \\xa0i recommend using this technique followed by some deep breathing while visualizing something that helps you feel relaxed a favorite place a pet etc \\xa0these three things in conjunction can be of great assistance\\xa0one key component in addressing anxious thinking is building the skill of relaxation \\xa0i recommend an app called headspace which teaches relaxation through some simple guided mediation super easy to do and a great way to begin to build relaxation skills \\xa0plenty of sleep and reducing caffeine intake can also be things to explore hope this helps': 1742, 'hi therei first want to let you know that having these thoughts is completely normal studies have been done that show that  of human thoughts are negative so you are not alone\\xa0i like to think of thoughts as a tornado if you are in a tornado you are completely consumed by it and it is nearly impossible to do anything beneficial however when you are lets say a mile away from a tornado it is still scary but you have the option to do something that is important to you such as get shelter or make sure your family and friends are safe\\xa0when unhelpful or scary thoughts arise we tend to start a war with them which is the equivalent of jumping into the tornado this makes the thoughts and emotions bigger and intensifies the feelings that go with them\\xa0so the question i imagine you have is how do i get out of the tornado there are  steps to doing thisget distance from your thoughts by adding i am noticing im having the thought that to the front of them for example i am noticing i am having the thought that something bad is going to happen to me\\xa0 \\xa0the purpose of this is not to decrease your fear or get rid of the thought these thoughts might always be there and that is okay because that is how the mind naturally works so struggling with that is a waste of time and energy the purpose is to gain some distance from the thoughts so you dont get swept away by them you can imagine them floating along like leaves in a stream or clouds in the sky and often the same thought will come back again and again but thats okay just continue to notice it with curiosity i imagine the thoughts get in your way of doing what really matters to you so if you can get a little bit of distance you can do things that are fulfilling and meaningful to you\\xa0tune into your body and notice what sensations come up and where you feel them most intensely then breathe into them and make room for them our  main emotions

person can do i agree with sherry that being patient with yourself is important here are a few things i would  get clear on the behaviors you really want to change and make sure they are behaviors

on a job interview is something you can actually do and something that you may consider to be demonstrating confidence whatever your change of behavior is make sure it is something you can actually change  if you are going to give up a behavior decide what you are going to do in place of it so if you are going to stop showing up late for work then you are deciding to be on time for work and demonstrating your value of being punctual  if you are going to make changes really nail down why you want to make them what is it about making these changes that is important to you as a person for example if you have the goal of weight loss the reason this is important to you as a person may be because you value selfcare knowing why you want to make changes is both your motivation and your compass for getting there  once you know why you want to make these changes i strongly suggest setting small goals if you set too high of goals you may not accomplish them and just feel worse so make

sessions unless the client has new goals or simply wants to checkin periodically to make sure that they are still on track sometimes referred to as relapse prevention\\xa0when a client is not progressing and feedback has been taken and attempts have been made to make the therapy more helpful for the client but to no avail than it is considered unethical to continue to work with the client

counseling sessions can end for any number of reasons among them are the clients inability to make forward progress in therapy the clinicians inability to help the client for a variety of reasons a mutually agreed upon time frame for a number of sessions to be provided or the financial challenges of the client who decides that they need to put their resources elsewhere in this last case a counselor should never cancel sessions with a client simply on the basis of the clients inability to pay that is traditionally seen as an unethical practice other arrangements can be made to provide care to the client which in itself should be paramountwhen the client and therapist decide that services are done it is best if there is at least one or two more sessions to allow a case file review to occur and to bring an appropriate psychological sense of closure to the client and vicariously to the clinician as well those this is perhaps not as important this transition gives both a sense of having reached the end of a journeyrather than some abrupt departure from it an abrupt ending in therapy can have a varying level of impact both emotionally and psychologically on the client and therapist sometimes the closure of therapy is the result of a program of therapy being formally completed in which there is a mutually known albeit perhaps approximate date of when that program will be finished in this case the client is likely feeling that impending closure and has time to prepare mentally and emotionally from a place of being the client in therapy to a place of healing growth and situational resolutioni have always worked in therapy with the following slogan if you will that i learned years ago during graduate school not every therapist is good for every client and not every client is good for every therapist it is perhaps one of the most important guiding views i hold in working with clients the therapeutic relationship is driven by mutuality  the desire of the client to get better at living life and the therapists desire to truly see the client heal and grow when there is a block in this process from either side that prevents that synergy from occurring the relationship that should be established may not be able to form or if already formed may at some point be unable to move forward in these instances referring the client to another type of service or clinician is appropriate usually this can be seen pretty quickly by either party though sometimes it is not always clearultimately the client and counselor need to work together to discover if the needs of the client which is paramount are being met in the therapeutic engagement with their current counselor or if other arrangements need to be made to go elsewhere if both are observant in this process they can work together to maintain that sacred space and continue to reach the goals that have been set eventually therapy will end but hopefully based on the clients successful journey to the place where they wanted to go and thus opening the next chapters of their life to a space that is more whole and brighter': 1784, 'hopefully both the client and counselor would together decide when to terminate counseling sessions its really helpful for the client to leave counseling with a solid sense of what he or she has accomplished in counseling so it can be a good idea to spend some time

why a counselor may seek to terminate with a client and these will each have different processes by which the counselor will come to that decision here are a few examples\\xa0the counselor may determine that the clients needs are outside what the counselor is competent to be able to work with a person may have come to the counselor talking about a particular issue but either when they first met or as counseling progressed it may become clear that the issue is in fact something different or that there is an additional related issue if that issue is outside the competence of the counselor the counselor should look for alternatives the most common of which would be to terminate and refer beyond clinical issues this could also come up around particular other related facts such as the culture of the client or linguistic issues this could also be the choice of the counselor if they know someone that they feel would be a better match for the clients issues\\xa0another reason for discharge and possible referral would be if the relationship does not seem to be a good fit no counselor is the right person to work with everyone if the right level of connection is not happening the counselor will often look first at what they are doing might talk about it with the client and ultimately will admit that things dont seem to be working to allow the desired therapeutic process to work a similar process would be followed if the counselor determined that the client might not yet be ready for counseling as evidenced by lack of engagement such as frequent cancellations not doing any agreed on work between sessions showing up late or being really guarded in session\\xa0the easiest situation to decide on is when a person has met their counseling goals and have nothing new that they are working on while this is the easiest one to determine it is also probably the hardest one for the counselor as they may be like the client in not wanting the relationship to come to an end however counselors know that this is part of the process they will also determine this by regularly reviewing the treatment plan or by sending in the sessions that the work has come to an end this type of termination maybe final or may be with the intent that the client will return later to address other things that have been identified but for which they are not ready to move into\\xa0all of these and other situations involves the counselor being open to the relationship ending to monitoring how things are going then engaging in self reflection possibly talking with the client and then coming to a conclusion on which the counselor \\xa0follows through': 1786, 'from the very beginning of counseling sessions i emphasize that the work will and must end at some pointin counseling there

short term and long term therapy goals\\xa0 as therapy progress we verify goals on a monthly to a quarterly basis depending on the frequency of the appointments\\xa0 once the therapy goals have been met there is a closing session the counseling relationship is ended and the client can stop attending sessions\\xa0 in some cases the client can also establish new goals and determine if i am a good fit for their therapy needs or if they need a new provider in which case i provide multiple referralsthe counseling relationship could also end due to other factors like noncompliance when a client is not committed to the agreed treatment process or when the client’s or a counselor violates the counseling relationship \\xa0either the counselor or the client is able to end counseling\\xa0 although as mental health providers we need to provide a reason for terminating our therapeutic relationship and referral options as a client\\xa0no explanation is needed a closing session is highly recommended \\xa0¿cómo termina la terapia¿cómo un consejero decide cuando terminar las sesiones de consejería o terminar de trabajar con un pacientepara poder determinar el final de la relación del consejero debemos comprender las metas y parámetros de la terapia\\xa0 usualmente durante la evaluación inicial se identifican metas a corto y largo plazo con el cliente y se discute con el cliente como esas metas serán alcanzadas\\xa0 durante el proceso de terapia el consejero revisa las metas mensual o trimestralmente dependiendo de la frecuencia de las citas\\xa0 ya que las metas de terapia son alcanzadas hay una sesión de cierre y el cliente puede terminar la terapia\\xa0\\xa0 en algunos casos el cliente puede identificar nuevas metas para la terapia y determinar si el mismo consejero u otro consejero le pueden asistir la relación de consejería también puede terminar por no conformar o violentar los parámetros \\xa0establecidos para la terapia \\xa0\\xa0tanto el consejero como el cliente pueden terminar la relación de terapia\\xa0 como proveedores de salud mental los consejeros estamos obligados a proveer un razón para la conclusión del tratamiento y proveer referidos según aplique los clientes no necesitan proveer una explicación aunque es recomendable discutirlo en una sesión de cierre': 1789, 'it is usually time to end counseling sessions when it is clear to both the client and the counselor that therapeutic goals have been reached and enough improvement has been made that the client can continue without that support there are exceptions to this rule but for the most part this is when counselors begin termination for some clients this is an easy process that marks the achievements they have made in working through their emotions and difficulties for some other clients however this is a difficult process in which they are losing a valuable support and are understandably anxious about what life will be like without the frequent meetings ultimately termination is different for everyone and there are many ways that termination can be healthy and helpful': 1790, 'as a therapist who believes in client selfdetermination above most other elements of the process i want to as much as possible leave it up to the client to determine when they are finished in the case of a termination because a clients distress has resolved i might periodically check in with the client about how therapy has been going and if we want to reevaluate where we arethe more unfortunate situation would come about if i felt that i wasnt the best fit for the client i would offer that in words and ideas of therapists with names of who i thought might be a better fit and why it still is up to the client whether to continue however should they want to keep seeing me a part of the work would be about that want to see someone who professionally doesnt believe they can help as much as someone elsei also find it perplexing when i hear a client or on a personal level tell me that their therapist said they didnt need therapy i dont know that i buy into that scenario all that much because i do believe that yes not everyone needs therapy but that everyone can benefit from therapy and i dont believe it is the therapists job to deter someone from ever seeking out help of any kind': 1791, 'ideally termination should be a mutual process its not that the therapist kicks the client out at some point and says okay youre done rather over time the client will decrease the frequency with which heshe comes to session so that it may start off as weekly then decrease to biweekly then perhaps once every three weeks then oncemonth and so on throughout this process the therapist and client should have had regular check ins about progress toward goals if the client feels good about where heshe is in life heshe might decide to suspend therapy for now that being said the therapist should make it very clear that if the client ever decided to return for maintenance therapy or a check in heshe would always be welcome\\xa0there is no hard and fast rule to ending or a particular time period in which it must end what matters most is that the client feels good about it and knows that the therapist will always be there should heshe wish to return': 1792, 'for a therapist deciding to end counseling sessions or terminate working with a client is a thoughtful and intentional decision one that is not entered into lightly\\xa0while there are many considerations counselors take into account to help answer this question ill offer an example of two areas that counselors take into consideration when ending counseling sessionsdoes the client need different or more specialized care than the current counselor can provide this requires the counselor to determine whether referring the client to another therapist or health care provider is neededand has the therapeutic relationship reached treatment goals\\xa0while this question is specific to the counselor id like to also add that a client at any time can end counseling': 1793, 'in general i usually let the client decide when this should occur sometimes with some clients it will be a joint agreement but even in that case it should weigh mostly on what the client feels in short therapy ends when you feel your donec': 1794, 'i will work with clients and continually review progress with them and determine if counseling is helping\\xa0 if a client appears to have less to talk about in sessions appears more stable for a period of time and has reached therapeutic goals i will talk about termination\\xa0 some clients however i may continue with on a monthly or bi monthly process to allow for checkins to see how they are doing and if they need more help at that time': 1795, 'there are several reasons for a counselor to decide to end counseling \\xa0a major reason to end counseling is if the counselor feels that he or she does not have the skills or experience to work with the client \\xa0this may happen during the intake process or after working with the client for some time \\xa0if the clinician feels that the client is not benefitting from the therapy it is ethical to suggest that the client terminate the therapy \\xa0the process of termination must not injure the client and if necessary the clinician may need to refer the client to other treatment modalities \\xa0another reason to terminate working with a client is if the client needs a higher level of care \\xa0if the client has a crisis or is at risk of hurting himself or someone else he or she may need a higher level of care \\xa0in this circumstance the clinician may need to involve outside services such as a crisis unit \\xa0a third reason to terminate with a client is if the clinician feels that he or she cannot remain professional with the client relationship \\xa0for example if the issues that the client is working on bring up something significant for the clinician and the clinician feels that he is unable to separate that from the professional relationship \\xa0in this instance the clinician should refer the client to another therapist \\xa0finally if the client has reached her goals for therapy and no longer needs treatment the clinician and client should terminate treatment': 1796, 'counseling ends when the client has received the maximum benefit from the therapist even if the therapist believes the client is not making progress the client may feel they are improving and receiving a benefit and the therapist may see a benefit and the client does not it is best to have ongoing dialogue with the client to determine when termination is appropriate': 1797, 'goodbyes can be hardchances are most of the goodbyes you have experienced in your life have beendifficult saying

usuallyend therapy should end when a client does not need further assistance is notreceiving any benefit from therapy or might be harmed by continuing to workwith a particular therapistin the best case scenariothe decision to move on from therapy and “say our goodbyes” happens when boththe therapist and the client feel like the client is ready to move on and moveup\\xa0 ending the therapeutic relationshipshould actually be worked on from the very first session what i mean by thatis there should be an understanding that the work we do together will have anending and that is a good thing because it means the client has gained theskills to continue working on themselves independently so the first session ihave with clients usually outlines a plan where the end goal is discussed andwe both have an understanding of the skills the client wants to learn or whatthey hope to achieve now sometimes there aresituations where the therapist ends the relationship and the client may takethat

are some situationswhere a therapist might end the relationshipif the situation the clientis dealing with is out of the therapists scope of practice the therapist mayend the relationship and refer the

and helpful\\xa0 a therapist whois going through a painful divorce may have difficulty working with a couplethat considering divorce a good therapist may see that their judgement may beclouded and want to refer the client to see someone else this is good practiceand helps the clientif a client is activelysuicidal or actively using substances then the therapist may end therelationship and refer

healthy relationship and they get to feel a sense ofcontrol on creating that ending\\xa0good luck to you': 1798, 'in the best case scenario its a mutual discussion and decision if not \\xa0ive had the discussion initiated both ways by me when i sense the client has gone has far as they want by lack of interest in accepting or completing homework assignments missing or cancelling appointments usually at the last minute lack of participation during sessions \\xa0client initiates by asking me pointed questions about why the need for homework assignments by forgetting their calendar or their checkbook   by suggesting that we make appointments over longer intervals once a week to once a month for example \\xa0i rarely have had to terminate a working relationshipthats why i dont charge for the first visit so we know if we are a good fit before we start working together \\xa0then i periodically ask whether the client feels we are making progress moving in the right direction talking about the most relevant issues etc': 1799, 'in my therapy practice the decision to end therapy is mutually made together with the patientotherwise the person can end up with a sense of tremendous rejection and abandonmentthe way youll both know therapy is coming to a close is that the discussion will feel lighter and move easilythe persons mood will be better they will smile more sit in their seat in a more relaxed way look more at ease take better care of their appearanceone of the ways to end therapy is to gradually decrease the frequency of the sessionssometimes people who are in my practice start to come each three weeks then monthly then every three monthsthis gives a sense of security friendliness and casualness to the therapy and demedicalizes it as though the person was treated for a medical symptom and the symptom stops completely one daytalk therapy is about life and life problems usually end graduallyi end my therapy in a way which mirrors the life process in which many interaction and situation problems show their effects gradually and show different effects over time': 1800, 'hi there\\xa0there are a number of reasons why a therapeutic relationship might end including but not limited to the client reaching their goals the client reaching a place of acceptance where they wish to remain or even a breach within the relationship \\xa0the last aspect should likely be taken to supervision in order to be fully processed \\xa0all of these things could happen and usually happen organically again except for the last example\\xa0your question however was about the counselor ending treatment this is a bit more difficult and can be very nervewracking \\xa0it may be beneficial to take this with you to supervision as well \\xa0its important to understand why you feel the need to end or terminate with the client as well do you feel that they would be better suited for another therapist have they achieved their goals or is it something elsein regular openended sessions i try to make a point of checking in with the clients fairly frequently in these checkins i use the time to ask the client how they feel about the sessions and if there is anything they wish to focus on more astutely \\xa0i also ask if they have any immediate goals that they would like to prioritize \\xa0in goaloriented sessions i check in more frequently to ensure that both the client and i remain focused and should they wish to shift their focus that they recognize it is part of my responsibilities to make sure we move back to the desired goal\\xa0often especially in longer term therapeutic relationships we as clinicians can see that the client has reached their goal however they are apprehensive about ending therapy \\xa0this is actually a great place to go with them why would they feel unable to handle issues in their external or internal environment without you often having this open discussion can increase empowerment and mastery that said it could also highlight other issues which the client may have been apprehensive about going into within therapy and now as the relationship seems to be ending feels more confident in bringing these up\\xa0in the case where the relationship is a toxic one terminating with a client may be the best option for both of you its a difficult conversation but recall that part of the role of the therapist is to model that these discomforts can be managed\\xa0i hope that this brief response can assist you going forward': 1801, 'this is a question that is very specific to each person there are definitely some variables but i can give you some general ideas for when counseling might endwhen a client has met all of their goals at least to a degree when they feel that they no longer need to work on them with the assistance of a counselorsometimes a decision is made that a client is no longer benefiting from counseling at a certain timesometimes clients have to remain in counseling in order to receive medication this depends on agency policy but sometimes it is a requirement if the medication is necessary and cannot be prescribed by a primary care physician frequency of sessions is usually decreased greatlyim not sure why you are asking this question but it is also something that is often discussed at the beginning of treatment oftentimes discharge goals change as treatment progresses because more is known about clients their goals changes in their goals and many other things changes are normal but your counselor probably has discharge goals in mind at least generally from the beginning i strongly encourage you to ask about it': 1802, 'im sorry to hear that this has\\xa0happened\\xa0counselors are legally\\xa0and ethically required to make sure that they always put the

licensed professional counselor social worker psychologist are expected to put the health and wellbeing of the client first each professional discipline does have a code of ethics as well as a licensing board in each state in order to get licensed the therapist must agree to abide by the highest standards of conduct including state local and federal regulations in addition to the code of conduct you do have the option of reporting this person to the appropriate licencing board in your state the other concern is if this person has unauthorized access to your credit card if you did not give it to him or authorize use this becomes a legal matter that you can also report to the legal authorities in your city or town therapy and counseling are effective because professionals gain the trust of the client betrayal of that trust by crossing boundaries and developing a relationship outside the therapistclient relationship is hurtful please know that the vast majority of counselors are

between a demanding job family responsibilities and everything else that can come up stress becomes more and more part of our everyday life one of the best ways to combat the toxic effects of stress on our bodies social lives and overall well being is to engage in selfcare but not the selfcare that most people think of like vacations or massages the best selfcare is the kind that helps you live the life that you already have rather than escape it you see the reason why vacations and massages dont work long term in reducing stress is that they allow you to escape from what is causing the stress without truly fixing it so you just return to what already stressed you out so instead you need to find ways to help live with the stressors that you already have they can be things like creating a more manageable schedule introducing healthy eating or exercising financial planning and even learning a few simple relaxation skills the key to combatting stress is to make small but

not answering you that could be effectiveid also encourage you to consider how much this is bothering you if it is causing a significant amount of anxiety say more than  if  is really anxious i would

happy to have the opportunity to explain my approach when i am determining what type of personality a client has i take my time and really absorb their lens point of view to themselves and others determining a personality type takes some time getting to know the person and building rapport after taking time to get to know them and learning about their view they have of themselves and others it is important to pickup on more specific personality traits which comprehensively contribute to a personality type clinicians including myself often witness certain traits that are enduring and consistent which indicate a type of personality for example if a therapist is noticing that a client is exhibiting traits of organization needing to be on time planning and perfectionism these traits contribute to the type a personality\\xa0in addition to utilizing clinical judgment clinicians often use personality assessments and follow the guidelines of the  ': 1855, 'thats a great question

we all go through a period of time where we think we arent worth anything sometimes these feelings are a result of low self esteem or because of shame the most important part of dealing with this

having these thoughts stop take a few deep breaths and try to reframe what youre thinking': 1859, 'there is nothing wrong with you sometimes we get intrusive thoughts that can be worrisome one things that can be helpful is to identify if there is a trigger to these thoughts  something in your life that makes these thoughts more common an experience a person a place a situation etc it will also be

messages we have received from other people and later internalized them so in that sense these thoughts are yours and belong to you but you have received these messages from somebody else even though

encouragement or a colleague showing interest in you i hope this helps': 1862, 'those kinds of thoughts can be quite difficult to handle but if they are your own thoughts and not voices you are hearing which can be very different they likely are not new to you from what ive learned from clients i work with often these thoughts have been quite useful for them over the course of their lives that through criticizing oneself it is a way of motivating oneself however in your case and in most of those clients it has caught up to them and its almost like they no longer need the motivation that they can do just fine motivating themselves by themselvesi think its important to see these thoughts as the voice of the inner critic that inner critic was there for a long time again because it i like to identify it as a thing inside of you thought that you needed motivation in the form of criticism to stay on task with your life but now that that kind of sentiment is no longer needed by you it might be time to have a different kind of relationship with it but it wants to be heard it doesnt want to silenced or stopped in your words so instead of trying to ignore it perhaps we can see all the ways you are worth something and internalize take in let those ways resonate with you sit with them think about them so that the inner critic can see that it isnt quite correct in what it is saying in essence you are instead sitting with the thoughts or worthiness instead of worthlessnessif that is challenging sometimes seeing someone who is objective such as a therapist can be helpful they can help you see the ways in which you are strong have resilience as well as any positive attributes that might be hard to see in the face of this loud inner critic and above all if you feel like this doesnt resonate for you and that the voices might actually be voices an evaluation should be sought to further tease out what sorts of symptoms you are experiencing': 1863, 'we have thousands of thoughts a day some thoughts we choose to think and some thoughts are random as you describe we cant control the first random thought but as soon as we become aware of it we can make a conscious choice to change the thought positive affirmations are messages we intentionally read to or tell ourselves to help us counteract negative thoughts if you find yourself under stress on some days more than others you may notice an increase of these negative thoughts about yourself\\xa0 to help you neutralize your negative thoughts and make it more natural to randomly think positive thoughts about yourself you might find it helpful to work with a therapist who specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy this professional can help you build insight into your errors in thinking help you develop a stress management plan and provide you with additional tools to boost your selfesteem': 1864, 'many people have thoughts like those you describe and often it feels like someone else is saying it because they are things that may have been said to you when you were very young \\xa0when young children hear negative things about themselves they tend to internalize these negative ideas and to form negative core beliefs \\xa0the good news is we can learn to stop these thoughts and to replace them with healthier thoughts \\xa0the first step is to catch yourself when you are thinking these thoughts and to stay stop then replace it with another thought \\xa0so for instance maybe you fail a test or get rejected by a romantic interest \\xa0you catch yourself saying you arent worth anything stop this thought and replace it with you didnt do as well on that test as you would have liked \\xa0lets figure out how you can do better next time \\xa0or she may not want to go out with you but someone else will so the idea is to develop a voice of a friend who can tell you the kind of things you would say to your own best friend \\xa0you might also pick up the book feeling good by david burns he gives many tips for how to change negative self talk': 1865, 'talking to a licensed profession who can discuss this in greater depth can be best\\xa0as a general information in short i can say that our thoughts are greatly influenced\\xa0by our early life experiences our thoughts are processed through schemes these are mental images or templates by which we make meaning of the world around us \\xa0while our upbringing has a great influence on the way we see and interact with the world around us as adults however we are not condemned to abide by them for life in psychotherapy you learn to change negative\\xa0schemas with positive ones yeah if you had less than optimal childhood you would have some sort of negative schemas that unconsciously lead to selfsabotage your efforts for success and happiness the research in the field of interpersonal neurobiology suggests that without conscious awareness and reflective practices we tend to interact with the world by repeating old habits of mind on the other hand in psychotherapy you can learn helpful\\xa0strategies to increase your conscious abilities to stay in control of your mind in the present moment and reduce intrusions of negative mind habits\\xa0yoga meditation and tai\\xa0chi are also found to increase selfawareness and lessen the intrusions of negative selfjudgment on ones\\xa0psyche': 1866, 'life is beautiful without unwanted thoughts and stress with proper strategies and tools it is possible to regain control over your thoughts i guess you are just having thoughts and not actually hearing voices my suggestion is to see a therapist and go from there': 1867, 'first off there is nothing wrong with you \\xa0in fact having random thoughts we feel we cannot control is actually quite common and normal

stuck and creating a selfprophization \\xa0if i think i am not worth anything i dont have to try and i will keep proving to myself that i am not worth anything \\xa0there are many techniques to work through and start to change our negative selftalk \\xa0there are actually many selfhelp workbooks that can help with this as well \\xa0a technique i like to use is meditation or mindfulness \\xa0this can teach us to accept our thoughts not fight them and then learn to let them go \\xa0release the power they have on us \\xa0if we can learn to release these and not ruminate on them this will give us the space to allow more positive and supportive thoughts to come in \\xa0mantras can help with this as well i am worth a lot i am important i have value \\xa0saying these to yourself everyday over and over even if at first you dont believe can retrain our brains to believe it and allow us to believe it \\xa0i have even wrote positive mantras to myself in my bathroom mirror so i am forced to look at these throughout the dayplease remember to not be hard on yourself as you begin to attempt to change the automatic thought patterns \\xa0it took a while for you to get where you are and it will take a while for this change to kick in and feel normal \\xa0so allow the process to happen slowly and allow yourself to accept you as the amazing and brave person you are': 1868, 'those \\xa0critical thoughts most likely came into your mind as the way you understood what one of your parents or some other adult who was very meaningful to you at a very young agewhen we are too young to distinguish whether what a grown person tells us feels accurate we absorb their opinions as our ownyour question shows youve reached the point of emotional maturity to know that your opinion about yourself is not the same as what is inside your emotional brain and stored there since you were too young to know that someone elses opinions are not necessarily your opinionsnothing is wrong with you everything is right with you to wonder how to more firmly establish your own point of viewstart the habit to revise any viewpoints about yourself which dont feel truethen replace these thoughts with better ones which you decide on your ownafter a while of doing this youll either automatically think the more positive thoughts about yourself or at least be in the habit to know that negative viewpoints about you are not necessarily true': 1869, 'sometimes its helps to have a name for a problem  it can make you feel less alone as in oh theres a name for this and other people have this experience too on the other hand naming the problem can also make it stick around longer as in now i have a special problem that has a special name and thats an important part of who i ambottom line whether its a disorder or not you would like life to be easier and not have to be pulled so much by other peoples energy and feelings you might want to try imagining that you have a volume dial on your empathy just like the volume dial or button on the tv that you can gently turn down to the point where you still feel whats going on but its not so loud you can also try imagining pulling your own energy back as if you were drawing your energy back home to the center of your own body and being letting go of the other people or characters that pulled your energy out so far this is a way create better boundaries and protect your own vulnerability just like on an airplane where they tell you to put on your own oxygen mask first before helping anyone else your empathy will most likely not really help others if you allow yourself to be depleted': 1870, 'it sounds like this would be difficult at times particularly if you feel misunderstoodyou may or may not know that we all have chemicals in our brain we also have different sections of our brain that become active when different things happen there is a part of our brain where a lot of our emotions originate that is also designed to protect us when we are going through things that have been physically or emotionally painful in the past and when that part of the brain is sometimes overactive perceiving threat when there is no actual threat at the time sometimes anxiety can develop this doesnt necessarily mean that everyone has an anxiety disorder but often if we are afraid of something that is not actually a legitimate concern for example most insects are not going to hurt me but i still do not like them very much we have anxiety about itthe first thing i thought of when i read your question is that perhaps some part of your brain are overactive i did find an article that may be helpful to you but i just want to caution you not everything listed here applies to you also the article uses the term brain anomalies this does not mean that there is something majorly wrong with your brain while i cannot tell you exactly what is happening im asking you not to panic over the term and to just consider that perhaps some of the chemical reactions in your brain may be a little overactive which may be able to be corrected with medication or something similar i cant tell for certain from what you posted whether or not this is what is happening but i would recommend that you either talk to your primary care physician or a therapist or psychiatristhere is the article\\xa0 you meet with your doctor or a therapist please try to convey how much this is affecting your lifethank you so much for posting here and i wish you the best': 1871, 'the world needs more people lately who have such a high degree of empathy which you describe in

maximize the effectiveness of your sessions': 1873, 'if your therapist is attentive and compassionate to what you are sharing then you will know you have a true connection with him or her and that he or she is the right match for you having a therapist who has a good location and inviting office is also a good sign that you have the right one': 1874, 'when you find the right therapist you will

have not been able to \\xa0the relationship with your therapist should be collaborative there should be a fundamental element of safety and trust \\xa0a strong relationship with your therapist takes time to cultivate but by the second or third session youll know if that therapist genuinely sees the world from your perspective and has a plan to get on how they will support your growth through this journey': 1875, 'the most important agent of change in therapy is your relationship with your therapist it is so important for you to find a therapist that you trust and feel comfortable enough to just lay everything out there and be vulnerable with therapy is really building a safe and healthy relationship with a professional that can then help guide you in some of the most intimate and emotional parts of your life this relationship does take time to build but usually you can get a sense of a therapists personality and approach from their bio and website once you have found someone that you think you could really connect with then its about looking at do they have the expertise you need do they have training in relationship counseling or in working with anxiety depression or trauma it is important to find an expert in the field so you are getting the best care possiblejust like if you were to go to a general family doctor versus a specialist i hope that is helpful': 1876,

doesnt fix it you fire him ': 1882, 'one way is to bring ones concerns or desires to the therapist directly rather than trying to subtly train them heres why i say that\\xa0one quite important healing factor in a psychotherapy is discovering that problems in the therapy and the therapeutic relationship can be solved together\\xa0it is a safety zone or bridge for practicing that if it can be done

already be in the right place \\xa0if you are having lots of doubt about your therapist being the right one interview other therapists': 1885, 'your comfort with a therapist is one of the most essential aspects of a quality therapeutic relationship \\xa0don’t be afraid to ask questions about the therapist’s approach and background \\xa0 do you feel heard and understood \\xa0do you find the feedback helpful and directed toward achieving your goals \\xa0ensuring open communication with your therapist is primary to making sure you have the “right” therapist': 1886, 'you should like and trust your counselor sounds like a big ole “duh” but you will not believe the number of people i have met with that have described their past counselor as “totally opposite than me” or someone who “didn’t get me” or “had totally opposing beliefs as me” suggestion to the masses do your research prior to entering counseling if you are someone who often cusses and is abrasive you might not want to pick the counselor who is highly professional and uses sophisticated language throughout their site pick someone who is more in line with your personality and wants for your futureand even if you do your research beforehand and figure out you aren’t vibing after a few sessions that’s okay let your counselor know this and who knows there might be something that can be done to make you feel more comfortable or maybe there isn’t but the good thing to note is that there are thousands of human helpers in your city and your counselor would be happy to provide you with a referral to a better fitting therapistview full post here ': 1887, 'i think its crucial that a person finds the right therapist questions questions questions first i would ask them if they have experience and training in whatever the primary issues are that you are wanting to work on you want to make sure the therapist has the skills and experience to help you its okay to ask have you worked with these issues before and can you tell me what methods you use to treat these issues and are the methods you use evidencedbased then i would ask what expectations the therapist is going to have of you the client do they expect you to do homework come with something to talk about each session or keep a journal see if their expectations align with what you are looking for and lastly i would schedule a session and try out the therapist\\xa0 see if you feel comfortable and safe\\xa0 as for training your therapist i would suggest you be the leader of your therapy ask for what you want be direct and do hesitate to tell your therapist if you feel you are not getting what you need they cant read your mind and would likely find that information very valuable they want you to feel better and to make progress and if they are going down the wrong path you should let them know': 1888, 'the first thing i would ask yourself is how do you feel when it is time to go to therapy what do you notice inside your body are you sick to your stomach neutral dreading it your body will give you indications as to how safe you feel your relationship with your therapist is like any other relationshipyou need to feel safe accepted and understood you want to see someone who you look forward to sitting across from and feel comfortable talking about whatever is on your heart and mind\\xa0 what are you preferences do you feel more comfortable with a male or female therapist does their age matter what kind of therapy do you want to do do you know if not you might want to talk to friends or family who have done therapy and ask them what they liked or didnt like what worked for them and what the process was like you can always talk to a prospective therapist about all the questions you have have they worked with others with your issues have they ever been in therapy where did they go to school what kind of training do they have etc you may not know in the first session or two if you have the right therapist but pay attention to how you feel while you are there your therapist should check in with you and ask how you are feeling if its not a good match for you your therapist should try and help you find someone who will be a good match your trust and connection with your therapist is the biggest indicator for success in therapy both of you should be concerned about your alliance and any good therapist will want you to find the best therapist for you': 1889, 'you can certainly ask the therapist questions such as their style or issues they have experience working with you can also determine whether a therapist is the right fit if you feel a connection or alliance and feel that you are working together toward your goals it is important to be open and honest with your therapist about what you are looking for in counseling': 1890, 'though this varies from person to person i think finding the right therapist involves finding someone who youre comfortable opening up to and speaking your mind including your preferred areas of focus for treatment its important to be aligned with your therapists general approach and to find someone who you feel genuinely attuned to both in practice and also with who they are as a person bringing up your needs for treatment is key and finding someone who validates your needs listens and welcomes feedback are all important building blocks for creating space for a great working relationship that promotes personal growth openness and invites adaptable approaches in session based on your individual needs': 1891, 'how do you know anything is right for you i think its an intuitive process and not always based on the objective expertise of the therapist either most psychotherapy research has concluded that the clienttherapist relationship is the strongest factor in success in therapy but in my view what is important to checkin with yourself around whether or not the therapist can hold space for all that you come in with for example not expressing discomfort with things you might talk about is a big run away challenge you enough where you feel like it is challenging you to grow but also where there is some part of you that does look forward to the sessionshow to train your therapist this could be a session in and of itself i must say the therapistclient relationship can resemble many of the relationships in your life or those that you seek out a therapist like anyone else in your life wont be able to give you what you need  of the time and then expect that you will be able to function outside of the space that can turn into a highly enabling process that wont help your other relationships however what the therapist can do and help you deal with is to tell you what they can and cant give you and then process the disappointment that you feel when they cant be everything you might feel you need': 1892, 'hello and thanks for your question its important to have the right therapist i encourage you to start by checking out the website of the therapist their blog articles will reflect the kind of work they do and the approach they may take while working with you if theres an email listed go ahead and reach out ask the particular questions that are on your mind share a little of what you are looking for in a therapist are you a goaldirect solutionfocused individual who is looking for someone to listen and ask questions are you less selfdirective and desire a therapist who can give you the consistent push to move forward are you interested in intertwining certain theory approaches maybe a cognitivebase or experiential art therapy or engaging in exercise while talking your therapist is out there its ok to try out a therapist for a session or two interview them as they interview you its also ok to change therapists ask your present therapist for a referral he or she should be willing to provide you with names of other providers and theres no shame in asking for it you deserve to work with someone who fits your stylei imagine theres already enough things happening in your life if you are searching for a therapist do you really want to train your therapist after all you are paying them for their knowledge and expertise it does take time to develop a relationship and developing one with your therapist is vital to your growth and satisfaction participating in therapy for the most part should be a time you anticipate and not avoid can you be honest with them are you trusting of the confidentiality they provide has this person clearly shared with you the limits of confidentiality if using insurance versus paying privately is there any part of you that just isnt sure its okay to assert yourself in therapy as a therapist i invite you to assert yourself as its a way to develop selfconfidence and resiliency not everyone thrives in therapy by sitting in an office or lounging on a couch some folks benefit by challenging themselves in various environments or are more comfortable in their homes online in the community at a retreat etc give yourself a gift of spending some time finding the person that can work with you towards what you are searching although theres the convenience of the local nonprofit agency in your area it may not be what you need also limiting yourself to the names of providers listed on your insurance may not lead to the right one there are many forms of therapy that insurances refuse to cover when this happens many times you can be reimbursed for your expenses by your insurance or you can use a health savings card or flexible spending card there are many many options therapy is about exploring yourself go ahead and feel freeif you feel as if you need to train your therapist it seems that person is not the right fit for you engaging in treatment should be quite comfortable from the outset of treatment many independent practitioners or small group providers offer a free consultation to start the relationship perhaps thats a place for you to begin good luck and i wish you well': 1893, 'the most important part of therapy is finding a therapist who is the right fit and you feel you can connect to feeling comfortable with your therapist and feeling that you can be vulnerable is what will assist in helping you find what you want out of therapy it also sounds like discussing with a potential therapist your expectations for therapy also i would read up on what the therapy process is like so that you are aware of the role the therapist is supposed to play in your life as long as a therapist is ethical and not breaking any ethical practices find someone you connect with and can share with': 1894, 'finding the right therapist for you may take time  or you may find one the first try two important things to think about when first finding a therapist are “do i feel safe” and “do i feel heard” the first time seeing a therapist can be anxiety provoking it may be uncomfortable unless there are giant red flags about a therapist things beyond meeting someone for the first time and answering uncomfortable but important questions i always suggest seeing a therapist  times before making a decision to try another it may end up that you feel like your therapist isn’t the best fit for you but again i encourage you to give them a couple times before moving on when you get past the initial sessions of paperwork and gathering information you can gauge the client  therapist relationship better and when you find the right person to work with you will know it': 1895, 'quick way to assess agreat therapist\\xa0a

a pair of black heels not just any black heels will do but when you find them you just know that your search is over it is also wise to expect that they won’t always feel comfortable': 1897, 'youll know you have the right therapist when after the first few sessions you feel comfortable enough to tell them things you wouldnt tell anyone else its important in therapy for that rapport to be built from the beginning and that you as the client feel comfortable enough to share what you need to share you shouldnt feel judgement from your therapist and you should be able to trust the advice your therapist provides therapy isnt about advice dont get me wrong but to truly implement the changes that need to be implemented to improve your life you need to trust the person giving the advice your therapist should have your best interest at heart and truly listen to what you have to say the therapist should be willing to meet you where you are in your world and attempt to see the world from your perspective to truly understand what you have been through you need to feel comfortable in therapy to be yourself and say whats on your mind therapy shouldnt be something that should be dreaded but it can get uncomfortable depending on the depth of the things being discussed': 1898, 'finding the right therapist can be difficult especially if youve never tried it before things to consider are location availability and what specifically are you looking for some practitioners specifically only work with a certain type of issue ie eating disorders adolescents anger management life transitions anxietyetc and others can work with a variety of concerns\\xa0as far as training your therapist you cant you simply let them know what you are looking to work on or what you think may be an issue for you depending on the way they practicetheir style of working with clients is how they will then decide to make a treatment plan that works best for you\\xa0you can always ask them their specialty practice population the problems they generally help others with and what type of mental health provider they are psychologist social worker licensed mental health counselor': 1899, 'choosing the right therapist can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming i know many people come to therapy with hesitations and potential fears but a therapist should be there to help you along the way and support you as you build a trusting and collaborative relationship you wont have to train your therapist to give you what you need through open dialogue and feedback you and your therapist together can determine what works best for you but do remember that being able to trust your therapist to guide and support you is key so if youre having a hard time connecting with your therapist after  sessions you will want to bring it up to them so you can discuss any barriers and if needed request a referral for another therapist': 1900, 'counselors do not expect to gain your trust during the first session trust is earned and gained through the therapeutic process you may know you have the right therapist if you feel a lack of judgement or even unconditional positive regard for the choices you make in therapy good counselors will keep you accountable for your actions without making you feel ashamed of the choice you madecounselors already have the training to give you what you need in treatment and if they dont they are ethically obligated to refer you to a provider that does that being said the first few visits with your counselor will be goal oriented creating realistic and obtainable goals that will allow you and your therapist to see positive change when it is made': 1901, 'you will know you have the right therapist when you feel at ease and comfortable to share deep feelingsyou do not hold back and feel total acceptance and validation by your therapist listen to your feelings and letthem guide your decisionyour therapist and you will work together to decide what is best for you with regards

thing is it has to feel right\\xa0 while that sounds vague and not very scientific it is the most important part of therapy\\xa0 us counselors call it therapeutic rapport and without it therapy is not very effective\\xa0 you want to know you can trust your therapist that you are not being judged that they respect your privacy that you feel comfortable talking to them about the good and the bad\\xa0 you want to feel heard and know you therapist is genuine  not all therapist are a good fit for everyone\\xa0 go with your gut  as an added note i recommend going with a therapist who has done their own therapy': 1903, 'what an important question i think one of the first things to assess is this do you feel comfortable with your therapist do you feel like you can talk openly about whats going on in your life without feeling judged do you experience your therapy as a safe space to process your thoughts and feelings feeling comfortable with your therapist is a crucial factor\\xa0once you feel comfortable with your therapist you can have a conversation about what works for you in therapy tell your therapist what is helpful and what you dont find helpful a skilled therapist can shift his or her style and techniques to meet your individual needs and this may be an ongoing conversation that the two of you have during therapy\\xa0oftentimes there is just an x factor between client and therapist that either makes the relationship work or can make it feel like something is missing this is no ones fault its just that not every therapist will be a perfect match for every client\\xa0if you feel uncomfortable with your therapist or feel like that x factor is missing it is a good idea to keep searching for therapist who is right for you': 1904, 'this is a great question finding the right therapist can be tricky because you dont really know how someone will be like until you meet them a few ways to prescreen are to visit the therapists website psychologytoday profile social media

in your life but we cannot mind read so if you dont tell us we wont know dont be shy about what you like and what you dont like a good therapist will listen to your needs process them with you and create a customized plan that works for you and your life a good therapist will also not take anything you say even criticism personally\\xa0coming to therapy is hard and often times you might not want to go what makes a good therapist is someone who understands this and tries to make you feel as comfortable as possible while you address uncomfortable topics': 1905, 'i believe that the right counsellor will help you feel empowered supported and understood you should feel comfortable opening up and not be concerned that they will judge you for what you say or decide to do i find this important to let my clients know during intake that they will never be judged for the decisions they decide to take while going over options in sessions together with me\\xa0in terms of what you need from treatment please feel comfortable to open up to your therapist and tell them what you need from them for example do you prefer them to challenge you with questions listen to your story and ask questions throughout or near the end give you work to do outside of sessions the therapy sessions will work best for you if you can help them support you in what will work for youit can sometimes take a few trials of different therapists to find the right one so please do not give up if you feel disheartened you should feel proud of yourself for taking the first big step in asking for help that is not easy to do and you are on the right track already': 1906, 'such a good question \\xa0sometimes clients will feel like they are not connecting with their therapist and will put it on themselves \\xa0in truth the bond between therapist and client is the  predictor of positive outcomes in therapy \\xa0ask yourself these questions does it feel like this person can come to care about me \\xa0do they remember from week to week what we touched on \\xa0do i feel compassion from this person do they allow me my difficult and painful feelings too or do they try to rescue me \\xa0on your other question  i suggest you ask your therapist what goals heshe has for your treatment \\xa0see if they respond with interest and participation or if they become clinical and distant \\xa0ideally you and your therapist jointly develop your goals and check on your progress on a frequent basis \\xa0i dont know if you can actually train your therapist  we can be a hard bunch to train  \\xa0 but you can definitely tell your therapist what works for you and what didnt work at the end of each session \\xa0how they react will also tell you a lot about whether this is the right person for you': 1907,

client doesnt train the therapistif you feel you are with a therapist who requires you to train them then politely decline continuing to pay for their servicesthen find yourself a different therapist who feels secure and knowledgeable enough in their skills to not require training by their client': 1909, 'thinking whether or not you have the right therapist can be overwhelming if you are not sure what you want or need but think of this you feel safe and comfortable that you share what you’ve never told anybody you feel understood and listened to you feel their support \\xa0you trust them do

have to do is share this with your therapist \\xa0if you don’t know then therapy is a collaborative process so both you and your therapist will work together to figure out your needs and how to best meet them': 1910, 'the right therapist is a combination of expertise in the areas where you require and fit as far as how comfortable you feel in speaking and sharing with that person\\xa0 people generally are quite good at determining whether or not someone fits well with their personality and style and another key to know whether therapy is working is to ask yourself\\xa0 do i see that changes have come about since working with this therapist\\xa0 do i feel better am i reaching goals that i set at the onset of therapy\\xa0 are difficult situations becoming easier by how i handle them training a therapist really isnt necessary as all it requires is open and honest communication in order to give effective feedback that will in turn be helpful to you and your goals': 1911, 'you have the right therapist if you feel safe with that person safety consists of feeling that who you are and what you say is valued the right therapist is not an all knowing person you must obey he or

want to waste your time and money with a therapist who is not a good fit for you\\xa0 i think the most important factor that makes a good therapist match is trust do you trust this person to be able

know someone who had a great experience with a certain therapist youll feel more confident in that person right off the bat\\xa0 second do your online research\\xa0 google the persons name and read

see if they have a blog social media posts or even just read the tone of the content on their website\\xa0 this might give you a glimpse of their therapy style\\xa0 finally you can call or email potential therapists and provide a brief overview of your presenting problem and describe what youre looking for in your ideal therapist\\xa0 it sounds like you have a specific idea of what youre looking for most therapists will be honest if they dont feel theyre going to meet your expectations\\xa0 some therapists offer free short phone consultations which can help you both decide if you

very few days where at least one client hasnt cried during therapy throughout the day\\xa0ijp': 1914, 'yes it is absolutely normal\\xa0 a good therapist can help your feel safe enough to really identify painful wounds\\xa0 there are some things that need to be cried about before they can heal\\xa0 therapists are fine with tears and buy tissues by the case\\xa0\\xa0that said if you dont cry during therapy it doesnt mean you are doing it wrong\\xa0 as long as you feel safe and have a sense that your therapist gets you and you feel progress during your course of treatment you are doing therapy right': 1915, 'absolutely its normal to cry in therapy sessions sometimes clients have stories they never shared with anyone or never said out loud and that results to crying crying is a normal reaction to feeling hurt or sad or sometimes angry i welcome all crying to my therapy room': 1916, 'crying in therapy is a natural response a relief to what you are going through it is an expression of emotions which is why you are going to therapy  to express yourself in a safe nonjudgmental space\\xa0rather than trying to stop crying sit on the couch with it until it is done and you have finished with the clearing the energy is not blocked is moving  a good thing its good to cry': 1917, 'although not everyone cries in therapy in my opinion crying is a emotion that some express in therapy crying is something that some express when it’s hard to discuss situations that may have never been discussed when discussing traumatic experiences and at times crying has even happened to some of my past clients when they have had a breakthrough in their therapy process': 1918, 'it is generally very normal to cry in therapy and for many reasons therapy should be a safe space to explore emotions as they come up and how you cope with these emotions i would encourage you to talk with your therapist about crying and to explore your experience of emotionsfeelings sometimes people will apologize for crying however emotions and expression of emotions is part of being human there is no right or wrong emotion to have how we express and cope with emotions is more of something to explore in therapy if it is hindering your life either extreme of keeping emotions in and avoiding or feeling like your emotions run your lifestruggle to regulate your emotions is something to explore in therapy as this is often the most distressing and troublesome for people hopefully this provides some insight': 1919, 'it is absolutely normal to cry in therapy therapy is a place to be honest about and explore your feelings without feeling judged honesty is the only way you will benefit from therapy and that means being willing to look at your true emotions rather than avoiding them': 1920,

comfortable opening up with and expressyourself comfortably': 1921, 'crying is clearing it is a release of energy and toxins crying is a good thing and a great way to let go and move forward': 1922,

something with which a client might be struggling and when it takes place in the therapy space it can be experienced and then worked throughits hard to necessarily say what some difficulties are that a counselor might encounter but i would say that not showing up like in any relationship is one of the hardest things for me and not just physically not showing up though that is certainly frustrating but not being open to the work is a form of not showing up while not every client is as motivated to change its helpful to my therapistclient relationships that the client try it might be hard for

other issues in addition there are many people who would tell you that counseling made a positive profound impact on their lives indeed some would tell you that counseling saved their lives now not everyone would tell you that counseling helped but when you think about it there are many medical treatments for a variety of healthcare issues that also do not help everyone so is counseling guaranteed no but it is something that is worth trying if someone is suffering or is just wanting some perspective or support also there is many different types of counseling different counselors have different styles and have different training for various issues this means that you are likely to find someone who has a good style and expertise in an area that you want to work on if you dont know where to go i suggest contacting your states counseling association they can help i think the real question that most people have is how how does it help that question is a bit more complicated because there are many different models of counselingtherapy that work in different ways what i can tell you is that regardless of the model of counseling the relationship between counselor and client is the most important factor i dont mean that the relationship has to be ooowy goowy but it does have to be one where there is trust and openness a counselor will spend time to make sure that you are working together as a team toward a common goal if you go to counseling and you dont feel this is the case tell your counselor an ethical counselor will welcome your feedback i hope this is helpful

about how else the other person is involved in the situation beyond this basic level a counselor will have expertise they can bring in terms of how people including you can effectively deal with this

does not help it is very important to find the right counselor for you ideally this should be someone you feel a level of trust and connection with who is also using a style that you feel confident in

feedback and also be able to share new insights the work you do is based on you and where you are at oftentimes when we talk to friends they bring their own agenda to a conversation and while they

gain more awareness of one could be contributing to what it is that you are trying to change both within yourself and possibly with people around youcounselors have experience in using lots of different types of techniques for example focusing on finding solutions looking at how the present situation could relate to your past using roleplays or examples in session to help you learn new skills or ways of looking at situations and probably hundreds of other thingscounselors are taught to look at what you are experiencing and ask questions about other related ideas that you may not have connected to what you are experiencingthere is a treatment plan in place usually after the first second or third session so both you and the counselor have an idea of where you would like to go with counseling what you are hoping to change or learn and a general idea of a plan for getting to your goalsin general i would say the followingyes counseling can help people who want something to be different in their livescounseling is most helpful when the connection between the counselor and the client is strong enough that some trust forms in other words not every counselor or technique is helpful for every persona lot of counselors will talk to you on the phone for a few minutes prior to you coming in for your first appointment to answer any general questions that you may haveif you are working with a counselor and you feel as though you are not clicking or connecting with one another give it three or four sessions before you change trust is not happening in one hour for most of peopleif you are working with a counselor and you would like to be getting more or something different out of it tell the counselor about that because typically modalities can be changedif you are

right match for youregardless of how you go about it i like to remind all people who call email text or walkin therapists are a bit like pizzas  if you dont like the toppings send it back there are

you to talk about your issue and to get a feel for the counselor \\xa0if you like what you hear by phone the next step is to set up a facetoface meeting studies show that the most important element in effective therapy is that you feel a connection with your counselor \\xa0trust your instincts and if you dont feel comfortable let him or her know that you dont think its a good fit \\xa0many counselors list on websites like psychology today and good therapy \\xa0visit these websites to learn more about therapists in your area': 1980, 'hi great question my suggestion would be to google therapists in your area \\xa0one great website is called psychology today which is a national site \\xa0you can search for therapists in your zip code and search more specifically for the issue you are seeking support about \\xa0its a great way to find out if they therapist has a speciality accepts insurance and whether they offer a free phone consultation i would then make a list of the ones that may be a good fit and then give them a call \\xa0 \\xa0hope this helps remember you get to ask anything you need to to determine if someone is a good fit \\xa0dont be afraid to ask anything \\xa0 \\xa0best of luck': 1981, 'hello counseling often begins way before the client ever actually calls the local therapist there is often a tipping point in the internal struggle that the client experiences where they can no longer deal with the issues on their own and thus giving the motivation to seek external help that said clients usually go seeking therapists based on what their insurance will cover or what is likely to be more and more the case in the near futurewhat they are able to pay for out of pocket that first phone call to a prospective counselor can often feel like torture but it doesnt have to stay that way counselors are well trained to acknowledge the inherent goodness of all clients and should be able to see and hear the sense of fear in the client of being judged or put down in some way the counselor you select should be compassionate caring able to join with you on your journey to resolving your issues or concerns and to do so without negative judgment of you as a person of worthonce you have found a counselor you want to work with you would then schedule an appointment to meet that first session is often very low key there might be some forms for you to complete which will help the counselor address your concerns and learn a bit more about you the counselor will typically provide you with what we generally call in the profession a professional disclosure or practice statement this document which may be several pages long usually outlines the counselors credentials practice rules forms of payment office hours emergency contact details and confidentiality guidelines under state and federal law among other details all of this benefits you as the client so that you are well informed and can focus your attention on why you are meeting with the counselorin the first session it is absolutely okay to be nervous heres a really big secret which is important to keep in mind as counseling begins counselors are often as nervous if not more to meet a new client as the client is to meet their new counselor its true we as professionals are trying to put our best foot forward to impress you with our awesome counseling skills while simultaneously hiding all the troubling unwanted issues that we ourselves have in our life too and being worried that we might not know if we can help the client sitting in front of us what makes it even more challenging is that counselors are often put on a giant pedestal of perfection by clients all while we as counselors tend to look at it like were standing on a three legged stool this is normal for us when seen from the eyes of the client counselors and clients are both human and we both make mistakes coming from that place of understanding might bring a sense of ease to both the client and the therapist as they seek to work together\\xa0part of this perception of perfection held by clients toward counselors is that the skills of the counselor might look like they have all the answers we honestly do not plain and simple counselors come from life experiences where they might be farther down on lifes road than you they hold completion of various forms of training and have advanced education yet we are in the end imperfect beings struggling to help imperfect people this makes it easier to be compassionate to new clients walking through our door with the hope that we will receive that same compassion in return very often we can find ourselves reflected in our clients lives with their struggles and can become more effective at helping if we have resolved similar issues in our own life so as you begin to seek out a therapist try looking for one who is aware of their own life issues and is actively working on them too someone who can meet you where you are at emotionally and can understand your sense of your struggle that you are facing at the present moment that counselor may be a good example for you as you enter into therapy and build your own strength and thus begin dealing with the issues more effectively you bring up in therapy': 1982, 'usually people call me by phone they introduce themselves we chat for a bit then we schedule a time for their appointment': 1983, 'honestly dont talk with your close friends first yknow the ones you actually can tell sht to not the more surface level ones godblesstheirsoulsbe with your family should you have a fine relationship with them tell them and utilize them they gave you life and that bond especially between a mother and son is unbreakablego with your faith as often as various faiths have been blasted and lambasted around the world understand that theyre ultimately trying to get you closer to god  and aint that a big thinggo with those around you first that actually might give a crp about you first before going to a total stranger youve never met before that is just as damaged stupid and imperfect as we all are': 1984, 'great question\\xa0 you can find a counselor by doing an internet

next you will want to ask about availability to make sure they have open times that fit in your schedule\\xa0 once you make the appointment in the first session you have with the therapist the therapist will ask a lot of questions about what brought you into therapy and what you hope to accomplish in therapy\\xa0 i usually use the last  minutes of that first session talking with clients

will usually be able to let you know what kinds of ongoing times for counseling that i have available over the phone scheduling is a big barrier to finding a therapist especially in new york when schedules seem pretty busy all aroundive heard a lot of statistics about how prospective clients in therapy will often wait for months before reaching out which is why i think that email is great coldcalling can cause an unnecessary amount of anxiety also who will hear me on the phone whereas email is relatively easy to begin a conversation from what ive foundi tend to recommend clients give a new therapist a couple of sessions to get a feel for fit but if its horrible after one session and you feel awful when you leave thats another story i might want to explore with you what felt so awful

process with ease and comfort\\xa0': 1994, 'starting the counseling process can be daunting but here are some ways that hopefully help make the process a little less overwhelming\\xa0firstid start

are important to you that you can ask to determine whether a particular therapist is a good fit many therapists offer a free phone consultation to allow you both to determine whether it is a good fitthen after you schedule the next step is to see what its like being in session to determine if the fit is still a match': 1995, 'the easiest way to start the counseling process is to do a little research online a quick search for the type of counseling you are looking for can be helpful there are lots of counselors out there to choose from so many times you will have to take it a few steps further than that check out their website social media and any reviews but remember people are not always very nice if you plan on using insurance to pay for at least part of the services look for one that is in your network you can find out if someone is in your network by looking for providers on your insurances website if your coverage isnt that great and you know youre going to be paying for it all anyway because youre an allstar and verified your coverage already with the insurance company then you can really pick any counselor you want but working with one that is at least out of network will give you the benefit of having it applied to your deductible if you have any questions about that process or just want some help in getting your benefits from the insurance company once youve started counseling better is a good option once youve found a counselor you think is a good fit for you normally the best step to take here is to call and schedule your very first appointment with many counselors you can now send an email but a phone call can normally tell you quite a bit about someone and their clinic once youre all scheduled they will either get you to do some paperwork before you come in or many times they just let you fill it out once you get there from there all you have to do is show up': 1996, 'approaching a counselor can seem intimidating at first but most

brings them to seek help from me so i might explore both their present circumstances as well as their history and try to start making some connections between the two but so that the both of us can understand what is taking place not every therapist goes into history in the same way either the way the therapist practices will often inform the ways in which they collect and look at datahowever above all my goal especially in the beginning of therapy is to work on developing a working rapport with any client most research states that the quality of the relationship rather than modality of

then share my thoughts with the client to see if they feel i am understanding them and on the right track \\xa0we would then discuss the best plan to address the clients concerns  \\xa0usually i will suggest strategies that i think may be helpful and ask the client for feedback about whether or not they think my suggestions feel helpful  \\xa0 i always encourage clients to be really honest with me

very apprehensive are usually feeling very relaxed by the time the session is over \\xa0usually when we get close to end of session time ill summarize what i think are the biggest concerns from what

questions in order to complete a thorough assessment of what you came to counseling for this assessment is required by most insurances and allows the counselor to give a diagnosis which is also required by most insurances in order for them to pay the counselor if you are paying out of pocket this diagnosis is not really required for payment but many counselors will still perform a comprehensive assessment because we really want to know what the issues are that brought you to us the better we understand what it is that bothers you what you would like to get out of the counseling and all the various things that tend to affect people such as family upbringing and medical issues the easier it is for us to help you reach those goals how the counseling actually plays out from there depends a lot on the theory that the counselor uses to direct their approach to counseling and that information is too much for this little post': 2005, 'a good therapist will discuss what

wanting to break this pattern  you seem to have some good insight into the situationthe type of behavior that you are describing is usually rooted in childhood issues with insecure attachment bonds

is going to take some time to work through in therapy  i recommend a book titled “boundaries where you end and i begin” by anne katherine  another book that might be helpful is “codependent no more” by melody beattie\\xa0in the meantime until you can work through your personal issues absolutely do not enter into another relationship  take however long you need to and work on becoming a whole happy emotionally healthy person on your own  needing another person to define you is problematic  that’s too much to expect from any individualfor a relationship to be healthy and happy both people in the relationship first need to be a whole person on their own  that means having a clear sense of self knowing who you are and what you want knowing how to set healthy boundaries and knowing how to meet your own needs  it is unreasonable to expect your partner to meet all of your needs all of the time  there will be times that they won’t be able to meet your needs  you have to know how to meet

whyemotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions in other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you dooften feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelingsbeing emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others  being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstoodmany people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions  for example men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness  therefore many men learned to turn feelings of sadness insecurities or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger  being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear  instead it makes us learn how to express it in other incorrect ways  if a man never learns to say “i am sad” or “that really hurt my feelings” and instead lashes out in anger then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstoodyou can control yourself and not explode  walk away remove yourself from the situation do whatever you have to do to not lash out  instead of reacting the way you normally would go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a “simple” thing upset you  what is the real feeling driving these outbursts  maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern\\xa0it might help to keep an anger journal  write down everything that gets you upset  that might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you off  talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience\\xa0': 2009, 'i will admit i am confused about this question  are you the other parent in

chance of their records ending up in court and that they themselves will have to testify in court  of course therapists are human and can make mistakes but i find it highly unlikely that a therapist would knowingly and willingly do something like this that is such a major ethical violation  not only are they losing their license to practice by doing this they are going to face criminal charges and jail time  if their clinical judgment is that the other parent is a danger to the child they dont have to resort to illegal means to try to prove this\\xa0if you have concrete proof that this has happened then there is a process in which you can file a report against the therapist with their licensure board  every therapist is licensed in their state  there are different types of licensures so you would need to know this therapists licensuremost accusations from the other parent are expected in a custody situation because people do tend to get quite ugly  dont accuse the therapist or the parent of anything just to try to make yourself look better and them look bad  have evidence of wrongdoing before accusing them of this  if this has really happened then of course it needs to be

change what others do but we can change how what they do affects us  if you have all of your emotions and all of yourself tied up into one thing like your pets then when that thing is taken away it causes a lot of emotional distress  it is really good to have a wide variety of interests such as friends hobbies games etc  develop other things that you care about and are passionate aboutanother reason for developing healthy coping skills to deal with whatever might be going on in your life is if you don’t have healthy ones you may develop some very unhealthy ones  you have to cope somehow

environments that can cause dysfunction in children one is when you grow up in a very rigid stern household where all decisions are made for you and you feel like you have no control over anything the other is a household where things were chaotic and you never knew what was going to happen next and had no stability people need to have some stability in their lives and need to feel in control over

have a friend that you can confide in\\xa0having depression in the past and being able to get through it shows me that you can get through anything depression alone is a very difficult problem to work through in addition to the communication problem with your parents it appears that you are also struggling with stress and anxiety we all have stress and anxiety in our lives if we didn’t none of us would be living anxiety  stress keep us on our toes often i have to remind myself of this as well however it is how we manage stress and anxiety so it will not overcome our lives\\xa0are you familiar with relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises meditation or yoga relaxation techniques can help you tremendously in reducing your stress and anxiety\\xa0deep breathing exercises are helpful when you are on the go such as school shopping out with friends or whatever extracurricular activities you engage in  most people do not take full advantage of their lung capacity i know that sounds silly but it’s true you would be surprised how much air you lungs can hold imagine being in the doctor’s office and taking deep breaths this is what you want to do when you are feeling overwhelmed andor stressed take a moment to take in at least  deep breaths and let them out slowly you will be surprised how well you feel afterwards\\xa0meditation and yoga are also healthy forms to working through stress and anxiety you will need a quiet place for your meditation you want to be “in the moment” and take in the peace and serenity all it takes is a quiet place closing your eyes and thinking of your “happy place” some people use meditation music as well if you have access to this type of music and or the internet for more ways to practice meditation please go for it\\xa0yoga on the other hand will take a little more work and practice i would not suggest you learning this on your own if you have never attempted yoga before find an experienced yoga instructor to teach you the ropes andor ask your school counselor about the possibility of getting someone to come to the school to teach the students\\xa0lastly in regards to your parents it is very important to be able to have a relationship where you feel comfortable communicating i would recommend writing a letter to them if you are unable to express how you feel in person a letter is more intimate and requires a little more effort on their end if they are open on working on this relationship maybe suggest family counseling to fully work on this issue\\xa0i hope this was helpful for you and i wish you the best\\xa0': 2015, 'let me start my stating this is important to take seriously  taking to his pcp getting a referral to a pediatric specialist and getting him to a relational psychotherapist would be my first tasks\\xa0i wont label this occurrences as normal yet it is important to note these things do occur my first observation is to say that it is a tremendous advantage that your son is communicating what he is experiencing id encourage him to continue to do so no matter the extent of his thoughts  his trust of you being able the handle his experience is of utmost importance his containment and sense of security is also dependent on your reaction to what he shares seek professional help communicating your support including a plan of action and reassuring him you will figure this out together will help you as you begin\\xa0': 2016, 'i am very sorry to hear of your struggles  i think that it is normal to struggle to get your feet under you again after a divorce especially after leaving a relationship that lasted  years so try not to be too hard on yourself  take it one day at a time and do the best you cani notice that you said he left you  this tells me that you didn’t have the strength to leave him on your own despite the fact that you say he was emotionally and mentally abusive and also cheating on you  low selfesteem can keep someone in a bad relationship because they think they can’t do any better  also abusers will make you think that they are the best thing you can get  the way i see it he did you a favor   you are now free to make your own life whatever you want it to be\\xa0take this time alone to work on you  as hurtful as it may be that other people don’t want to help you this is something that you need to do for yourself without feeling like you need someone in your life to take care of you  your statement “i don’t feel like i exist anymore” tells me that in addition to low selfesteem you also don’t have a clear sense of identify and rely on the people in your life to help define who you are  people can and will let you down  it is important for you to learn to handle disappointment learn to take care of your own needs and to gain a stronger sense of self\\xa0do nice things for yourself every day because you deserve it  even if it is just to soak a little longer in a hot bubble bath do something that makes you feel good  find a hobby that you enjoy  look in the mirror and tell yourself some positive affirmations daily  google “positive affirmations” to find some that resonate with you  such statements might be “i am a good person who deserves to be happy” or “i can do this”  some relaxation and meditation exercises may help you as well  there are some free meditation exercises that you can find online by doing a simple google searchtake this time to focus on you and try not to worry about what everyone else in your life is doing  when you are a happier more stable person the right people will come into your life without you even looking for them  good luck with rebuilding your life  i know it is hard  remember to take it one day at a time': 2017, 'hi there thank you reaching out for help it takes a lot of courage for someone that is being abused to reach out for help i want you to know that i am here to help you in any way that i can\\xa0first and foremost you did not mention whether or not you had children yourself by this man i’m going to assume there are so the most important thing right at this moment is asking yourself if you and your children are safe is the boyfriend currently living in the home or is he coming and going if he is coming and going or currently living in the home my suggestion for you to is to pack a bag for you and your children and go somewhere safe ie family members home friend or a shelter temporarily i cannot stress this enough although some people tend to minimize their abusers behavior ie they only do it when they are drinking they only do it when they are mad it’s those individuals that find themselves or their children in a serious situation so you can never take abuse physical or mental lightly because you never know what is going through that persons mind at that particular time it’s always better to be safe than sorry\\xa0secondly it will not be safe helpful or productive to attempt to talk to the abuser about your relationship abusers often times try and manipulate you into staying by apologizing or attempting to justify their behaviors this is the time you would want to go see a magistrate in order to get a protective order for you and your childrenit’s unfortunate that your significant other was involved with another women causing pregnancy however that is no longer your concern your concern at this point is keeping yourself and your children safe i would also suggest counseling for you and your children in order to work through these issues i hope this was helpful and please stay safe and take care of yourself\\xa0': 2018, 'its hard to let go of the dreams you had regarding your wedding and engagement this was something that you and most women think about for years so its understandable to be disappointed but please be aware that it is rare that any wedding is perfect you may envy your friends weddings but more than likely they had a few mishaps of their own andor it wasnt as perfect as they had planned it either\\xa0however like you know the marriage is the most important thing  how many women are envious that you are in a happy stable relationship i assure you that there are plenty\\xa0try to live in the present considering that dwelling on the past can still not change how you were proposed to or how your wedding day transpired focus on what you can control now perhaps you can plan an extravagant renewal of your vows or change the look of your ringi would also be upfront with your husband and explain why youve been short lately but after that close that chapter and move on it sounds like you have a wonderful companion and you certainly dont want to lose this due to a situation that is impossible to change': 2019, 'i am sorry that you lost your mother that is a really hard thing for someone to go throughthere is really no set time for grief to be over but i agree that if it has been three years and you are still crying every day then this is past the time for normal grief  i do not know how old you are and if you are in school or have a job but i would imagine that if by now you literally were doing nothing but crying every day all day someone would have noticed and would have gotten you some help  for one thing bills have to be paidthere are typically five stages of grief and they can come in any order  you can go back to another stage that you previously experienced denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance are the stages\\xa0at first people are usually in denial over the fact that they lose someone or are losing someone  this may mean that you deny they are ill or deny that they have actually diedthen comes bargaining in which you may beg god that if you can only have this person back then you will do whatever\\xa0depression is when the reality has settled in and when we cry and really feel the loss  it sounds like you are stuck in this phasefinally acceptance is when we accept that it has happened and we pick up the pieces of our life and move onwhen we lose someone we never forget them  we may always have certain days that are tough such as holidays or any special remembrance of your loved one  but we do get to the place where we accept that death is part of life and that it is inevitable and that life goes ona therapist can help you explore the reasons for your extended grief and can help you with coping skills to better deal with it  one suggestion i have is not to try to run from the sad feelings don’t try to not feel them  embrace the feelings  let the feelings wash over you and accept them  trying not to feel something is not going to help  sadness is a part of life and needs to be felt just like happiness does  unpleasant feelings are not to be avoidedi am sincerely sorry that you lost your mother and that you have had such a hard time of it for three years now  you deserve to be happy and to live a full life  i am sure your mother would not want you being sad for so long  i wish you all the best as you continue to try to heal from this loss and deal with your grief': 2020, 'hi there wow this sounds like a sticky situation however i’m here to help guide you through this decision\\xa0first and foremost you must ask yourself if you ever loved your sons’ father or was it a situation to where you two got pregnant and stayed together for the child it’s very common to stay with your partner when a child is involved regardless if love is involved or not because “it’s the right thing to do” right well not entirely  although staying with your partner because you have a child together may seem right in fact it hurts the child in the long run if you are not love with your partner you will show distance unhappiness sadness possibility of frequent arguments and cheating  when a child grows up in the home and witnesses these types of emotions  behaviors it is unhealthy as heshe will expect their own relationships to be such as a responsible adult you are supposed to be there to shape and model the future for your child just remember what you do your child will model\\xa0secondly do not sell yourself short from love everyone deserves to be happy and to have someone to share their love and intimacy with however being in love with someone you have never seen before can be very risky honestly that sounds like lust and the longing of love  humans have needs and when people are unhappy in their current relationship they often seek out what they need  if you decide to pursue the second relationship i would suggest setting up an outing with a friend or two in order to get to know this person as there are a lot of scammers these days\\xa0finally i am not convinced that this has anything to do with choosing between two guys  this seems as if you are making a decision to end the relationship with your child’s father or not you should ask yourself if you were in love with your child’s father first off if you were you would have never sought after love  i hope this was helpful for you and i hope i was able to shed a different light on your situation take care of yourself': 2021, 'i am sorry to hear of your relationship struggles\\xa0one thing i wonder is did you volunteer the information about your past or is this something that he asked about  in the future it is probably best to leave details out of conversations like this  i think it is common and natural for partners to ask about the sexual history  for one thing it is a good idea to be checked for std’s before entering into a sexual relationship with someone and it is fair to share that information with each other  partners usually want to know how many you have been with and what kind of sexual preferences you have or if there is anything you don’t like to do  this gets into a gray area for some people  i don’t necessarily want to know how many people my partner has been with and i certainly don’t want a whole lot of details  sometimes that is an image i just don’t want in my head about my partner  vague details are usually enoughhowever i understand that your partner has the details and is not happy with your past  this is a reflection on him not you  this shows insecurities on his part  you cannot control how he will react to information that you provide to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information  the past should remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future   if he cannot handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship  you can offer couples counseling to him and see if he will go with you  i have seen relationships recover from some very serious problems such as infidelity  it takes two people who both want it to work to make it work though\\xa0if your boyfriend cannot get over your past you may have to let him go  don’t keep yourself tied to someone who is not right for you  constantly holding your past over your head and holding that against you is only going to bring you down and eventually you may start having insecurities or low selfesteem due to this type of treatment i don’t see that you have done anything wrong  if you aren’t cheating on him now and you answered his questions about your past honestly how he handles that information is on him  ultimately relationships have a tendency to come and go don’t fight to hold onto someone who is not right for you  it is okay to be single and enjoy being the best you that you can be  in time the right person for you will enter your life': 2022, 'im sorry you are feeling uncared for im sure there are plenty of people that care and love for you that you are not taking into consideration sometimes when we get upset we may think irrationally and see the world as all or nothing however take a deep breath relax and start focusing on the positive relationships you have with others regardless of how small or insignificant they may seem i think you will quickly realize there are people out there that care a great deal about youi also think it would help for you to surround yourself among people who you can identify with and share common interests with maybe you can attend a religious service join an interest group ie reading club sports group etc or start a group of your own most importantly you need to tap into your interests and surround yourself with things that are beneficial for your own mental and physical health from this relationships will start to immerse\\xa0you may also like to talk with a therapist regarding your feelings of being unloved this is an unhealthy way to think of yourself and

change is your attitude and thoughts about the situation that you now find yourself in  one thing that is inevitable about life is that stuff happens and it is not always pleasant some people take

question\\xa0there are so many people putting forth their  everyday and often times do not get the credit they deserve without being able to fully understand where youre question is coming from i think there are a couple of different ways to look at this questionfirst i think its important for us to consider the message being sent by those in your life stating that youre not good enough is that actually what they said or is this just what you heard sometimes because of our own selfdoubts and fears we skew and misinterpret the messages we receive from others again listen to the message being sent and attempt to remain objective is the message being sent coming from a place of love or concern if so have an honest and open communication with that individual about what your concerns are regarding the amount of energy and time youre spending on being good enough explore with them how you feel your already giving your bestif the person is unwilling to work at understanding this concern you have then it may be time to explore the relationship some relationships we engage in can be toxic especially if the other person is toxic it may be they have their own stuff going on and they feel the need to constantly put others down to make themselves feel better if youre in the direct path of this individual then it serves to reason you will probably be in the direct fire as well explore whether or not you want this relationship to continue in your life if its a relationship that must continue then work on what you will do to distance yourself from their toxicity or their problems until theyre willing to work on these issues for themselves then it may be necessary to find an exit strategy such as leaving the room or simply refusing to engage in the conversation\\xa0another perspective of this question is exploring the reason why its important for you to satisfy the expectations of these other individuals no one will ever be  good enough for everyone every single person has their own set of expectations in themselves and expectations in others it would be impossible to satisfy all of those expectations for every single person in our lives\\xa0the question becomes what is it within you that feels the need to meet these expectations there is most likely a part of you yourself as an individual that feels less than and feels as if you yourself are not good enough it then becomes impossible to every feel good enough for others because its really you youre trying to feel good enough for if you already feel as if youre doing

way of having the kind of relationship that you might ideally want with your sister sometimes it is hard to like someone if we have a lot of old frustration and resentment and being able to talk about it in a constructive and kind way can lead to more understanding and respect and sometimes actually liking each other\\xa0': 2081, 'you might be surprised how normal you are anxiety is incredibly

ultimately unknowable and this unknown can provoke a lot of anxiety\\xa0mindfulness based practices like meditation  maybe there is something like this in your religious tradition  can be very helpful in making peace with the unknown in the present moment the more we can learn to live in the moment  the less we get hung up on anticipating outcomes for our lives that may never come true mindfulness

recommend being open and honest in your communication with your partner \\xa0your fears about his response are valid as he made an assumption which you cannot disprove because you cannot battle against a shadow fact\\xa0if you feel comfortable doing so you can always ask him why he is so concerned you are unable to remain faithful and challenge those beliefs with the facts that disclaim them \\xa0you can also ask your partner what it is that he needs from you to help you to help him trust in your responses \\xa0in the end these are issues that you cannot conquer for him  you can only guide him and show him the path towards trust \\xa0you may suggest couples counselling or that he seek out a professional to talk to as well \\xa0but in terms of your question only you can decide

wonder what it might be like for you if you took on an experiment of trying to really see the people around you and make little attempts to acknowledge and connect with them  fellow humans on this journey of life a good morning at the bus stop or really looking at the person who you buy your groceries from or thanking or complimenting someone for something that you notice and appreciate while

jealous wanting space and to be left alone or a whole bunch of other reasons regardless of the underlying motivations for fighting most conflicts result from misunderstandings and assumptions about the motivations of others and one of the best ways to start figuring out what is going on is to sit them down and have some conversations with them\\xa0these conversations should be centred on getting a better understanding of why they are angry with each other and really understanding them it is important that they each know that you are committed to understanding their experience rather than simply sitting them down and lecturing them about what they are doing wrong the more they are able to understand each other and feel understood the more likely they will be cooperative and considerate of each other\\xa0one exercise for doing this that can be very helpful is active listening where one person speaks and the other person reflects back what they heard the other person say and then checks for understanding this is hard to do but it often illuminates where the misunderstandings and assumptions are if this doesnt work it may be time to get a family therapist or counsellor involved who can help facilitate dialogue and resolve conflict\\xa0': 2090, 'it seems that you have been very disconnected from each other which naturally \\xa0could contribute to symptoms of saddness and even

attractive men does not necessarily mean anything there will always be attractive men and more attractive men than your partner and these attractive men will be even more appealing when you are in a longdistance relationship far from the arms of your partner loving someone does not mean that you stop being a sexual being who no longer notices and desires attractive men\\xa0attraction results from a number of factors beyond appearance  including the degree to which you feel emotionally open safe and connected and how in tune you are with each others bodies it sounds like you think very highly of this man everything else is perfect about him maybe it is worth spending some more time together in the same place if that is possible before deciding on marriage or that you are not truly in

your coping behaviours at night it sounds very isolating and also very silenced \\xa0as opposed to the sad music why not try all music allowing yourself to experience the wide breadth of emotions that are circling within you \\xa0one of the other recommendations i would make would be to try and journal about some of those thoughts and fears in order to release them in a positively cathartic

asking for clarification why not try asking your mother why this particular fightsituation is eliciting such an angry response \\xa0often the simple act of expressing that we dont understand the other

young single people from peers and media to conform to ideas of what is normal and to meet expectations in terms of sexual experience dating etc while some people may judge an adult who is a virgin  others will respect your choices and feel even more attracted to you because of your choices experimenting with sex so long as you are being safe and respectful is also completely okay and normal\\xa0since expectations vary and we cant be happy if we are always comparing ourselves to other people we need to ultimately trust that being who we are and building a loving relationship with ourselves is the key to meeting someone who will cherish us for all the ways that we are special and unique virgin or not when we are able to really accept ourselves and trust in our loveableness not a real word but you get what i mean then meeting someone special is simply a matter of time and effort  putting ourselves out in the world in situations where we are likely to meet other single people looking for relationships\\xa0when you are most afraid of being alone  remember that this fear is simply a reminder of how much you value relationships use that passion about wanting relationships to build the best relationship you can with yourself and then one day soon some lucky person will stumble into your life and benefit immensely from your passion and your ability to be authentically who you are rather than pretending to be normal or whatever that is anyway hope this helps\\xa0': 2114, 'so wonderful to have a boyfriend who is able to understand and forgive you what do you think that

like that you talked to your son to see if anything is wrong there is some key information here i dont know your sons age whether he spent any money whether he put the card back or how many times hes stolen and my answer might be different depending on those details but ill give you my thoughtsi see it as every childs job to figure out the rules and find where their power is in the world in order to accomplish that many of them test limits what can i get away with is a question they have to find the answer to if a child knows the rules theyre much more likely to not test limits because they already know the limits so part of testing limits is experimenting with stealing and lying not all kids steal but i would say pretty much every child lies at some point its a normal behaviour and most of the time its about small things that dont matter and we dont even find out\\xa0stealing a debit card is a bit more serious and im not surprised he lied about it if you absolutely know that he took it its okay to tell him that you believe he did this thing and also lied about it its appropriate to give a consequence for this type of behaviour so that the child doesnt do it again the consequence should be as natural and logical as possible the behaviour stealing was harmful to you so doing you a favour with extra chores might be a good idea\\xa0its funny because as parents we try to tell our kids that lying is bad but they know theyll get a consequence if they tell the truth so there are natural deterrents to being honest we dont want people to know our mistakes its a dilemma if you really want to focus on the lying part you can tell him that you wont give him a consequence for the lying if he decides to come clean with the truth within one day that gives him incentive to come to you with truth it sometimes works with kids to give them a chance to come clean and then reward them for telling the truth\\xa0you can set your child up for success and train them to tolerate honesty put a cookie on the counter tell your child to take the cookie at some point in the day then ask them later if they took the cookie youre making honesty fun kids love games\\xa0basically theres as much power in rewarding the positive behaviour as punishing the negative\\xa0if this is the first serious offence for your son dont make a big deal of it consequence him and see if he learns if its a pattern thats different and you may want the input of a therapist\\xa0': 2132, 'hi atticathis is a question i think a lot of people deal withthey feel confusion about why they cant forget about or get over or stop connecting with someone who they absolutely know isnt good for them\\xa0in your case part of the problem is that he keeps trying to get back in touch with you for some people honestly its a game to see how much power they have over you or its their need to control you if you dont want contact from this person its really important to give him clear messages about boundaries dont contact me again and then ignore all of their communications any interactions or responses from you at all will feed their behaviour remind yourself why you dont want to be with them i hear you doing that already when you say he has nothing to offer me thats great selftalkbut lets get back to the question of why we have a hard time letting go of people like this sometimes its because we still hope they will change maybe we remember who they used to be or how they used to treat us and we think it can go back to the way it felt in those good old days the problem there is that over the first few years as intimacy grows people tend to show more of who they are not less so what theyre eventually showing you is who they are and what theyre capable of people do change and grow but it wont happen at your pace accept that person for who they are and stop expecting them to change\\xa0another reason we cant let go is because we picture our ex with someone new in the future and we wonder if they will be a better person for the next partner in their life this is a normal but not a healthy thought its as though we want them to stay maybe apologize and heal our hurts maybe make up for past mistakes you deserve that healing you deserve better than you got you deserve apologies but to expect that from the person who hurt you and hasnt demonstrated that compassion as yet is probably foolhardy\\xa0it is my belief that underlying some of the above scenarios is the deep belief that we must somehow be responsible for the hurts our exes have caused if you blame yourself in any way for someones poor treatment of you you will be dancing around trying to do things differently so that they can treat you better it will be impossible to let go because you blame yourself for their behavioursdraw a line their behaviours are about them not you and the only solution is to challenge and reduce thoughts of them and create physical and emotional distance these things plus time will help the events of the past fade from importance\\xa0': 2133, 'hello vancouver its really common for people to become very upset over small things sometimes the small thing is a trigger and the emotions arent so much about that event thats happening in the present they are more connected to old events that evoked the same feeling youve likely had too much of that feeling in your life and youve developed a sensitivity to it look at the small events that are triggers for you and ask yourself what same or similar emotion they evoke if theres anger there look underneath that is it powerlessness worthlessness hurt shame \\xa0then ask yourself when in your life youve experienced too much of that feeling as a child maybe but not necessarily\\xa0thats the first step and combined

assumptionsthe third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating maybe there are texts on a phone or someone has told you something they saw id say when there is some evidence its okay to present this to your partner and ask whats going on if this happens repeatedly and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that dont make sense then its

thats a legitimate complaint when he drinks does he drive act aggressively or check out of the relationship avoid you all of these things are legitimate concerns and id stick to talking about those

are many coping mechanisms for binge eating and one of the best is actually attempting to normalize eating meaning you need to attempt to eat normally eating appropriately portioned meals  times a day with snacks in between if you binge then it may be helpful to remind yourself that when you attempt to compensate for your bingeing behaviors and you end up feeling restricted from over exercising or undereating then this actually leads to a binge again thus reverting you back to the cycle if you binge it will be helpful to try and get back on a normal schedule of eating instead of trying to compensate for the binge although it may feel counterproductive getting back on a normal eating schedule will prevent you from entering into the restrictive cycle\\xa0it can also be helpful to remind yourself that the binge has already occurred it is in the past and the goal is to move forward without focusing on the past focus on what you can do differently next time what emotions or situations led up to the binge what can you to do prevent or change the circumstances that led to the binge or the way that you handled the situation\\xa0lastly if youre struggling with normalizing eating it can

experience these behaviors\\xa0do in order to start feeling like they have some power again\\xa0here are just a few  they realize there is no right answer trying to be logical with someone who doesnt

something that is being talked about a lot has he had an opinion this wont tell you for sure if he would be okay with learning you are transgender but at least you would know if there is hostility toward transgender people to tell you the truth the best way to tell your dad is whatever way feels right to you there is no right or wrong way best or worst if you want to tell him when you are by yourself with him thats perfect want to have a friend with you for support equally perfect whatever thing you need to do and of course there is always the option of not telling him anything until you are comfortable doing so unfortunately the response from your dad cant be predicted some parents are totally cool others not so much this is one reason why having someone with your for support is

symptoms that have returned skin picking and some other behaviors are not uncommon for people who are experiencing something like anxiety many people report that they do this when they feel anxious and some say it calms them down it is not really a surprise that you are constantly trying to change things and even starting fights to do so these are ways to try to avoid escape and distract yourself from the feelings of anxiety and depression that is a very normal thing to do nobody likes these feelings and so distraction is something we naturally try in order to get rid of them the

my experience that family makes a difference assertive knowledgeable persistent family can improve the quality of your loved ones care hospitals are highly pressured to discharge people quickly but they can not discharge a homeless person without someplace to go if your family is willing to accept your brother that will be the path of least resistance for the hospital if the family refuses they will be forced to find another path for him you can also pressure the hospital to refer to rehab after psychiatrically stablized which may only take a few days and that may give your brother more time to begin making clearheaded decisions\\xa0if your brother has a psychiatrist that person should be actively involved i had a patient patchedandreleased three times in spite of my advocacy and him literally begging\\xa0to remain and stop his voices we finally got a  day hospitalization because i strongarmed his psychiatrist into demanding that the hospital stabilize his patient \\xa0if your brother has a history of noncompliance with oral medications you can push the hospital for injection which again will help your brother stay stable for longer\\xa0best wishes to you and your family\\xa0': 2383, 'i would want to know where do you put your needs often times we show people how to treat us based on how we treat ourselves first identify how to practice good self care which can

'hello i commend you for your courage in taking a look at the role alcohol has in your life it sounds like youre concerned about what happens when you drink too much and i suspect you already know the answer to your question about whether you have a problem or not i imagine you would like to stop feeling guilty and would like to avoid cheating on your boyfriend or other negative consequences and maybe have a fear of being or becoming an addict or alcoholic you might have a problem but that does not necessarily mean that you are an addict\\xa0i dont have information to know if addiction or dependence or other words would best describe where you are with drinking but it sounds like its begun to have some negatives so forgive me using words like addict dependence and so on i mean it more as a road map than a diagnosis the feedback im writing here is very general and doesnt address physical dependence and many other factors that might apply to your situation \\xa0one of the ways to think about substance misuse is to think of addiction as a disease of avoidance let me repeat that it is a disease of avoidance your ultimate task in living a balanced life is to figure out what youre avoiding and develop other ways to manage those feelings experiences and so on and of course along the way you may want to look at triggers situations biological vulnerability social pressures coping skills relapse prevention planning and so on depending on where you are in your drinking you might very well benefit from expertise and support\\xa0remember also that alcohol depresses our central nervous system and disinhibits us that means that alcohol is often a substance of choice to relax destress calm down etc also it allows feelings thoughts and behaviors that we usually inhibit to be expressed if you were unfaithful and often angry thats your first signpost for angry drinkers it is often true that you dont drink and then get angry you drink in order to express anger\\xa0i recommend you find someone you can speak frankly with who is knowledgeable about addiction wishing you the best health and wellness\\xa0': 2388, 'youre in a lot of good company and its great that youre in a positive relationship congratulationsi often hear people talk about loving yourself and self esteem we often seem to blame ourselves for not loving ourselves enough or put ourselves down

and with our environment in other words you cant just snap your fingers and voila now i love myself where there was an empty space or selfdoubt before we grow that warm coal inside ourselves through the friction of contact with others who value and validate us \\xa0allow yourself to be patient with yourself as you experience this new relationship you are learning a new model of who you are and how you fit into the world what a marvelous gift for you\\xa0you may also have fears that the current joys may be temporary or unreliable these fears of loss may get in your way however understandable if you are truly close to your companion you can share with her that you are loving your relationship but sometimes fear it will go away and sometimes have trouble really trusting it such a

therapy can be a rewarding process however often times we do not pay much attention to the messages being sent to our bodies i believe in somatic therapy which deals with our mind  body connection i would think it may not be a question of normal or abnormal however if it is impacting you then you must pay attention to that it would be helpful to explore the feelings youre having \\xa0with your therapist it may be something that needs addressing to help alleviate those feelings or have a better understanding of why they are showing up when it is time for therapy\\xa0': 2390, 'thank you for your question its completely normal and natural to feel nervous before a therapy session many people report having felt this way\\xa0i cant say enough regarding the amount of courage it takes to reach out and attend a therapy session for many people it can take weeks months or even years of contemplating whether to see a therapist or not before actually contacting one and attending the first session it takes courage to want to work through any struggles you may be having or personal growth you aspire toward\\xa0in your question you mentioned that youve gone several times and are still feeling nervous and shaky if you feel comfortable with your therapist and its a good fit for you i would suggest talking about this with your therapist you dont have to struggle each time you have your appointment together you and your therapist can work toward helping you have a different experience\\xa0': 2391, 'everyone has different experiences going to therapy being nervous can be a typical emotion one might feel emotions are our bodys way of telling us important information about ourselves i would suggest talking openly in your sessions about this that way you can process your thoughts and feelings with the guidance of your counselor there are probably underlining emotions fears or insecurities that are being stirred up during your therapy sessions your counselor might suggest individual counseling depending on what you learn about your anxiety in individual therapy you would have time to deal with your own stressors as you address your issues then you will have tools and skills that will be useful in addressing the couple relationship\\xa0': 2392, 'hi there\\xa0thank you for your question its absolutely ok to feel nervous going to therapy i have experienced anxiety going to see my own therapist there can be a few reasons why you might feel this way\\xa0first it is always unnerving to see a person who is a stranger and to share intimate things with that stranger you mentioned it has only been a couple of sessions your anxiety might subside as you continue to see your therapist and grow more comfortable with himher\\xa0another reason why you might feel particularly nervous is perhaps you are not comfortable sharing things as children we might have bad experiences opening up to others someone might bully or ridicule us and that experience can stay with us for a long time making it extra scary to share our intimate feelings and thoughts with others if this the case as you continue with your sessions and have positive interactions with your therapists this anxiety will subside with time and you will relearn that it is safe to share\\xa0and the last thought why you might feel the shakes is perhaps you know that you need to talk about some past experiences or memories that are uncomfortable and difficult\\xa0regardless of the reason it might help you to bring up your nervousness in your session and share how you feel with your therapist having an open dialogue about your anxiety with your therapist can help you resolve some of that anxiety and built greater trust with your therapist\\xa0': 2393, 'hi there\\xa0thank you for your openness about the challenge you are experiencing in your relationship sexual intimacy is an important part of many peoples life but how much importance is placed on it varies from couple to couple\\xa0the first step would be to have an open conversation with your husband its important you are both open about what you desire from sexual intimacy and how much intimacy each one of you wants for example asking your husband how often does he want to have sex week or month when having this conversation its important that you are both respectful and open with each other the point of the conversation is to get to know each other and not to solve a problem yet\\xa0there are couples who enjoy fulfilling platonicfriendship relationships with minimal or no sex because both partners are not interested in it if you are both on the same page  lack of sex might not be a problem\\xa0if there is a difference in your sex drive and frequency of desire i would recommend seeing a professional relationship  sex therapist as a couple to help you explore your current sexual dynamic whats creating it whats getting in a way of connecting sexually and to\\xa0assist you and your husband in finding creative solutions\\xa0': 2394, 'hi\\xa0break ups can be very devastating and even traumatic recovering from one is a process that is unique for everyone person and will take time its

yourself with people who love you and support you friends and family even though you might feel like being alone make an effort to be around them\\xa0 although you might not feel like it try to take care of yourself as much as possible eat healthily get regular sleep  vigorous or gentle exercise depending on your mood the last thing that we want to do when we are physically sick eg flu is to take care of ourselves even thought thats what we need the most but when we do get that chicken broth sleep and vitamins we recover much faster and with less discomfort thats exactly the same when it comes to emotional\\xa0pain take care of yourself keep\\xa0yourself strong and healthy so you can recover faster\\xa0 as much as possible put away reminders of the relationship you might not be ready to throw things out but try to put them away in a box in the storage or in a closet and also block social media reminders there is a lot of wisdom in the saying out of sight out of mind\\xa0 once the initial shock and intensity of the break up wear off try out something new in a relationship we often forget and give up on things that we always wanted to do or to try now its time to bring out that dusty bucket list and start trying something new\\xa0 if possible change your scenery by going away on vacation with a friend or even by yourself changing your surroundings can really help you change your thoughts mindset\\xa0and forget your ex even if just for a few hours even a weekend getaway with a couple of girlfriends can do wonders\\xa0 in addition to help you make sense of your past relationship and what went wrong i would highly recommend seeing a professional counsellor or therapist\\xa0': 2395, 'normal can be an insidious word to use because it can undermine your sense of worth \\xa0it implies theres one particular way you should be behaving and can leave you feeling crappy and abnormal if youre not behaving according to that prescribed standard \\xa0instead what id recommend is to pay attention to your emotional experiences when youre attending therapy \\xa0explore your feelings and thoughts without judgement and try to reflect and understand whats going on thats causing you anxiety \\xa0once you figure out the underlying meaning of the anxiety you can figure out a way to handle it and action steps to take to diminish it \\xa0': 2396, 'there are many possible ways dating your boss could go awry and jeopardize your occupational wellbeing so my recommendation is to hold off on presenting your boss with a personalized gift and instead focus on building attraction and romantic interest with someone who is not at the workplace \\xa0sometimes the element of power and unavailability can heighten our sexual interest but that doesnt mean its a healthy idea to pursue someone who is in a position of power over you at your workplace \\xa0': 2397, 'im sorry you feel so alone and isolated those feelings in and of themselves can lead to

better chance of saying everything you want to say in a calm but forceful way \\xa0the same with your friendsyou are probably a great listener and therefore attract people who want to talkso you need to let these friends know you need something in return \\xa0if you practice asking for equal talk time then perhaps these friends will respond and surprise you or if you make those demands youll start

approached i would suggest paying attention to the way you begin dialogue with your husband see if blame and criticism are present when blame and criticism are included bids for connection can quickly go off track this can sometimes start off with something like why dont you you arent you dont partners can quickly go into defensive mode if they feel they are being attacked and sometimes starting off like this can feel like an attack \\xa0also become aware of the time of day or evening when you approach your husband sometimes this can make a big difference for couples as far as when they can

into couples therapy with a trained couples therapist they are trained in helping couples begin to examine whats been happening that has caused a drift in your marriage\\xa0im also curious if there was a significant event that occurred around the time you started feeling distant if there was something that occurred during this time that is hard for you both to talk about couples therapy can help

loss for how to deal with this sudden change in our lives first it is important to acknowledge that losing a relationship is a loss and we need to grieve that loss if we dont allow ourselves time to process and move through the grieving process we may remain stuck and it may make it hard to move on so in some ways you dont want to move on too soon by just trying to ignore your feelings instead take good care of yourself talk to friends and give your self time to heal the second most important thing is to forgive yourself this is also an important part of taking care of yourself you might be blaming yourself and reliving moments when you wish you would have done things differently by replaying those thoughts you remain stuck when we begin to forgive ourselves we truly begin to heal lastly in my experience the people who have the most difficulty moving on have not really severed all ties with their ex they are still following them on social media or even checking in with texts this is

extremely difficult to build a secure functioning relationship\\xa0from the information provided in your question it seems as if there is some avoidance evident in your relationship avoidance of being

once you name it then you can take a break to cool off and come back to each after your nervous system has had a chance to calm down about  minutes the key here though is to make sure you have a plan in place  when things are good between you  an agreement between you that when you both start to get escalated youll name it or have an agreed upon code word to signal you dont want to continue this

time that are in the repair phase of their relationship after infidelity the short answer to this is not only is it possible to have a satisfying and fullfilling relationship after infidelity it happens more often that we may know the current rate of infidelity is high while its not important to go into many reasons it mau be important to know you arent alone in this my biggest suggestion for you would be to seek out a professional counselor that specializes in working with couples healing from infidelity best of luck ': 2423, 'there are different reasons why a counselor may seek to terminate with a client and these will each have different processes by which the counselor will come to that decision here are a few examples\\xa0the counselor may determine that the clients needs are outside what the counselor is competent to be able to work with a person may have come to the counselor talking about a particular issue but either when they first met or as counseling progressed it may become clear that the issue is in fact something different or that there is an additional related issue if that issue is outside the competence of the counselor the counselor should look for alternatives the most common of which would be to terminate and refer beyond clinical issues this could also come up around particular other related facts such as the culture of the client or linguistic issues this could also be the choice of the counselor if they know someone that they feel would be a better match for the clients issues\\xa0another reason for discharge and possible referral would be if the relationship does not seem to be a good fit no counselor is the right person to work with everyone if the right level of connection is not happening the counselor will often look first at what they are doing might talk about it with the client and ultimately will admit that things dont seem to be working to allow the desired therapeutic process to work a similar process would be followed if the counselor determined that the client might not yet be ready for counseling as evidenced by lack of engagement such as frequent cancellations not doing any agreed on work between sessions showing up late or being really guarded in session\\xa0the easiest situation to decide on is when a person has met their counseling goals and have nothing new that they are working on while this is the easiest one to determine it is also probably the hardest one for the counselor as they may be like the client in not wanting the relationship to come to an end however counselors know that this is part of the process they will also determine this by regularly reviewing the treatment plan or by sending in the sessions that the work has come to an end this type of termination maybe final or may be with the intent that the client will return later to address other things that have been identified but for which they are not ready to move into\\xa0all of these and other situations involves the counselor being open to the relationship ending to monitoring how things are going then engaging in self reflection possibly talking with the client and then coming to a conclusion on which the counselor \\xa0follows through\\xa0': 2424, 'hello\\xa0there are many ways to approach a counselor and starting the process however they all start with picking up the phone \\xa0its most definitely an uncomfortable feeling but once that first step is taken it is often met with a wave of relief\\xa0my recommendation is always to call and speak with a therapist over the phone before scheduling an appointment listening to how they converse use their tone and inflection may give you a brief insight to how they will respond to you and increase your comfort right away you may also discover rather quickly that this therapist is not the right match for youregardless of how you go about it i like to remind all people who call email text or walkin therapists are a bit like pizzas  if you dont like the toppings send it back there are hundreds of therapists offering all kinds of styles of therapy  take the time to pick one that suits you\\xa0': 2425, 'im alway wary of assigning a term to a feeling as often that term becomes more important than the feeling itself from the very little that you have written it is clear that you are going through something that has made you extremely low affected your selfesteem and motivation limits your enjoyment of formerly pleasurable activities and affects your feelings of selfworth all of these are aspects of being depressed though you can be depressed and still not have depression\\xa0counseling is definitely a place where you can go and sort out why you have had such a sudden a drastic change to your mood sometimes our mood can be effected by changes in our routine losses or significant disappointments talking with someone will not only help you to better understand why you are feeling this way but they will also help you to ground yourself and learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood and strategize for the future\\xa0i do hope that you will reach out feeling alone can be harmful over long periods of time as it can stop us from seeking out the support we need\\xa0': 2426, 'hello workplace stress is one of those areas of living that troubles many people who need an income to survive the interactions between you and coworkers is a mixed bag and sorting that out can be difficult also if you are feeling under appreciated and not well paid this can add bitterness to your lot of emotions a few questions can be kept in mind as you work through your situation do you have the option of talking to your employer about your experiences and feelings with regard to your current work do you have local resources that you can use to find different jobs in your field do you have connections with employment counselors or agencies that can support you with strategies in dealing with workplace stress these questions might cause others to bubble up and could begin a new journey into a new fieldwhile still at your job what can you do to take care of yourself are you taking breaks do you eat lunch at the office or do you go somewhere away from the office to eat what do you do when you have a few moments to breathe understanding that you can indeed find even the smallest strategies useful for selfcare can help bolster your energy and give you some support as you move through the day seeking the support of family and friends can be helpful as well knowing your

contribution or to have value and worth with the people around us and we begin to internalize those messages of selfworth if that alone were not enough you are trying to figure out where you want to go in life and who you are supposed to be in the world teens are faced with pressures of being judged by your peers for how you present yourself following current fashions possessing the trendy things and hanging out with the in crowd heres a secret that might help with most of those issues not much of those problems ive just described will really matter as they might seem to right now in the real world if you are feeling depression because you feel you lack some of those things that are seen as important by others like your peers i can assure you that being someone who is kind compassionate understanding of another persons suffering and the effort you make to be the best person you can become in the world will far outweigh anything you experienced in your teen yearswhen we are young we judge everything based on what our peers have what they say the way they dress whos popular whos not popular and for the most of it all of that is external so the question becomes are you trying to fix the feelings on the inside the internal stuff with the trappings of all the stuff on the outside the internal that is to say do you feel that if you had what your friends have you would be happy and less depressed depression is usually a symptom of something much bigger it is not typically a problem by itself just as a person who experiences a high temperature may likely have a cold so fixing the symptom requires looking at the possible causes in your post you mentioned that you live with your dad are your parents divorced or separated or has your mom passed away either of these circumstances could certainly cause depression finding out when you started feeling depressed might be able to pinpoint the trigger that caused it which requires looking at when you last felt really happy it is also important to keep in mind that as a teenager your emotions are often being experienced very randomly and sometimes without cause it is part of your emotional development but as you grow older can learn how to manage those emotions better and practice doing things that help you feel better without causing harm to yourselfhave you tried talking to your dad about your feelings or maybe another relative if you feel safer doing so do you have a friend who is your best friendsomeone who is there for you no matter what if not there is a service you can use that is a national number for teens to talk with teen peer counselors they are teens like yourself but they have some insights that might be helpful its called teen line  it helped me when i was in my teens and has helped lots of other teens as well you might find a place to get some referrals to other local services in your area if you want are in washington state and would like to connect with me directly you call link to me via my profile page or perhaps finding a counselor in your local area might be useful most towns and cities have some form of low cost counseling you might also check with your school for assistancedont be afraid of not always knowing how you are supposed to feel adults dont always have a handle on it either being a teenager carries a lot stress fear and uncertainty but you are not alone and there is help if you reach out for it i wish for you the very best and bright future\\xa0': 2429, 'i am so sorry for your loss \\xa0generally therapists only have a duty to report self harm

my experience medication seem to help it is also important to understand when you hear voices the most  meaning it is important to understand what the triggers are it is also important to understand when the voices are the least  meaning what helps you deal with the voices better my clients have reported that their triggers are being in social gathering or around strangers or for some even the tv trying to identify your triggers is helpful for some people clients have also reported that listening to music watching tv being with friend or family helps them deal with their voices every individual is different and you need to figure out what works for you and what triggers your voices my suggestion is to see a therapist  health care provider and then go from therei hope this helps \\xa0': 2459, 'starting the counseling process can be daunting but here are some ways that hopefully help make the process a little less overwhelming\\xa0firstid start with finding a therapist through a therapist directory and searching for a therapist specifically in your area and with the expertise youre looking for there are many reputable therapist directories online that offer specific information and links to therapist websites to learn more about how they can helpnext\\xa0id pick two or three of interest to contact directly have a list of questions that are important to you that you can ask to determine whether a particular therapist is a good fit many therapists offer a free phone consultation to allow you both to determine whether it is a good fitthen after you schedule the next step is to see what its like being in session to determine if the fit is still a match\\xa0': 2460, 'each counselor may have a different process so im not the end all authority here \\xa0for myself i review policies and confidentiality concerns with people first and answer any questions they have\\xa0then ill let them know ill be writing a lot in this session and i have an assessment form that i like to get completed but i want to have a conversation and ill ask questions as we go \\xa0my first question is usually how do you feel i can best help you today \\xa0some people are very at ease and tell me many details \\xa0others are a bit more reserved and i have to demonstrate more curiosity \\xa0even people who have been very apprehensive are usually feeling very relaxed by the time the session is over \\xa0usually when we get close to end of session time ill summarize what i think are the biggest concerns from what ive heard and confirm whether or not the person wants to work on those things \\xa0i also try to give an exercise targetting my biggest concern for them to work on in between sessions \\xa0for instance a relaxation method if they are very anxious \\xa0counselors are just humans as well so it does take a bit of time to really get to know another person \\xa0i always tell people that are apprehensive to give the counselor  or  sessions to determine if they really connect with them \\xa0i hope that helps\\xa0allison\\xa0': 2461, 'while you cant be responsible for your boyfriends feelings relationships do come with expectations \\xa0both people in a relationship bring their own expectations into it \\xa0these expectations are usually unspoken but result in conflict as you are experiencing here \\xa0your boyfriend expects you not to spend the weekend with this guy \\xa0he may expect you not to spend the weekend with any guy at all \\xa0he may expect you to spend every single weekend with him \\xa0youll have to decide if his expectations are ones you can live with \\xa0relationships do require some compromise out of concern for our partner but you get to choose how much you compromise\\xa0we get upset about things that make us feel insecure \\xa0you spending the weekend with an ex makes your boyfriend feel insecure \\xa0that doesnt mean you did anything wrong \\xa0it just means that you have to decide if its more important for you to maintain your freedom to spend weekends with whomever you wish or to help your boyfriend feel secure in your relationship\\xa0good luck \\xa0hope that helpsallison\\xa0': 2462, 'lots of people do cry in session but your therapist wont be uneasy with this \\xa0crying is a natural response and it also releases toxins so some might say its necessary \\xa0remember that you can be in charge of what you talk about in your session and if theres something that feels too uncomfortable just say im not ready to talk about that \\xa0your counselor wants \\xa0you to feel at ease and will probably not push you right away to a very uncomfortable place \\xa0as you get to know your therapist you will feel more relaxed and even not worry so much about how you appear to them \\xa0its normal to be anxious going into a new situation especially when you might not feel in control of uncomfortable emotions \\xa0dont give up go and put your best effort in\\xa0hope that helps\\xa0allison\\xa0': 2463, 'while this might not be the first thing you want to discuss when you meet someone it is important for you to be yourself \\xa0its better to weed out  people who cant accept you to find that one who can \\xa0': 2464, 'you are right that his insecurities are at the root of the issue \\xa0you cannot change that for him \\xa0he will have to do the work to handle those emotions on his own \\xa0what you can do is reassure him in whatever ways possible but always recognizing that you cant fix this for him \\xa0when i work with people who struggle with their partners past experiences i always frame it like this \\xa0everything that youve experienced has resulted in you being the person you are today \\xa0the person they claim to love \\xa0if you had not gone through some of those experiences you would not be in the position youre in now ready to commit to him and know that youre satisfied with that \\xa0just as when bad things happen to us we have to find a way to appreciate the lessons learned your fiance has to accept that youre the person you are today because of what you have gone through \\xa0celebrate that you have moved through that and have landed in this perfect position with himhope that helps\\xa0allison\\xa0': 2465, 'initially everything is a reminder because there is a trace of that other person present in everything in your life\\xa0when we lose someone were saying goodbye to what we thought our future was going to be \\xa0accepting thats changed and allowing ourselves to envision a new future is necessary to move on\\xa0start learning something new or try a new activity that youve always wanted to do \\xa0find whatever is good about being out of the relationship and focus on those things \\xa0this can be an exciting time of transformation for you \\xa0 as time goes by youll add new things in your life that arent entwined with this relationship and those things will begin to crowd out those things associated with the relationship \\xa0give yourself a little empathy no one goes through a breakup without being sad \\xa0its ok to be sad \\xa0its even ok to feel devastated \\xa0loss of a relationship touches a primal need we have to belong \\xa0it makes us feel insecure unanchored \\xa0in truth we are ok safe even \\xa0this experience will open different perspectives for you \\xa0there are lessons youll take from it that will add another facet to you as a person \\xa0maybe in time youll even appreciate this experience \\xa0im sorry youre hurting right now \\xa0best wishes to you\\xa0allison\\xa0': 2466, 'it is brave of you

with ptsd can be very emotionally exhausting but you can learn ways to cope with its challenges and find\\xa0fulfillment in your life again this means being proactively involved with the process learning about the problem and positive ways to manage it can be a good start this can also mean seeking professional help it is important to address the problem both at the\\xa0physiological and psychological level this can mean using medication that is prescribed by a\\xa0md\\xa0to reduce the intensity symptoms and also working with an experienced\\xa0licensed professional having healthy life habits such as good sleep hygiene healthy diet staying away from selfmedicating with drugs and alcohol and exercising can help reduce the intensity of the symptoms as well please consult with a

speak with the childs pediatrician since they are most familiar with the childs\\xa0developmental history also children tend to regress behaviorally when facing events and interactions they feel to have no control over this can be as simple as a loss of a pet a recent move death in the family \\xa0andor as serious as sexual abuse and other things if you have not spoken to the school that can be a good starting point\\xa0': 2468, 'talking to a licensed profession who can discuss this in greater depth can be best\\xa0as a general information in short i can say that our thoughts are greatly influenced\\xa0by our early life experiences our thoughts are processed through schemes these are mental images or templates by which we make meaning of the world around us \\xa0while our upbringing has a great influence on the way we see and interact with the world around us as adults however we are not condemned to abide by them for life in psychotherapy you learn to change negative\\xa0schemas with positive ones yeah if you had less than optimal childhood you would have some sort of negative schemas that unconsciously lead to selfsabotage your efforts for success and happiness the research in the field of interpersonal neurobiology suggests that without conscious awareness and reflective practices we tend to interact with the world by repeating old habits of mind on the other hand in psychotherapy you can learn helpful\\xa0strategies to increase your conscious abilities to stay in control of your mind in the present moment and reduce intrusions of negative mind habits\\xa0yoga meditation and tai\\xa0chi are also found to increase selfawareness and lessen the intrusions of negative selfjudgment on ones\\xa0psyche\\xa0': 2469, 'what youre most likely trying to get over is to be attracted to the qualities which you felt attracted to in the personthe problem isnt releasing yourself from the person per se \\xa0 letting go of a person means separating yourself from the qualities in a partner which you valuetwo possibilities existeither you continue to feel strongly that the qualities in the past relationship are still meaningful and youd like to base your next relationship on these qualitiesor the person had qualities which are no longer relevant or necessary in your life and this is the reason the relationship endedit is possible that even if you had an adequate exposure to certain qualities in someone that you simply miss the companionship of a relationshipsee if you can figure out whether you need the qualities this person gave you or whether you simply like being part of a coupleif you like the particular qualities of your previous parter and these are still relevant to your life youll attract a partner who has similar qualitiesbasically people attract what they needthe more open you are to attracting what you need in a partner the more likely your next partner will have these qualitiesin this way youll get over the particular person and still have the satisfaction to be in a relationship\\xa0': 2470, 'there is no wrong or right way to define a relationship i believe each relationship we are in is an opportunity to expand and to know self on a deeper level we are conditioned to believe that we are not valued or worth much without the confirmation of others and the world around us\\xa0give yourself time and try to not go to those who are toxic and enjoy the drama of others lives as s way to avoid looking at themselves\\xa0': 2471, 'youre expecting reasonable behaviors from your boyfriends fathersince the father is his your boyfriend is the person in position to speak directly with his dad about the expectations you and he have of the fatherif your boyfriend has a good relationship w his dad which is not what this sounds like then greatif your boyfriend has a stressed and tense relationship w his dad then somehow he needs to develop or be coached and encouraged by the people in his life who truly care about and know him a way to state the very reasonable standards you describe hereif all else fails then a new living space is always another possibility\\xa0': 2472, 'breaking any habit is no easy feat \\xa0 cutting down or cutting out cigarettes is very challenging and there arent any one size fits all solutions \\xa0fortunately there are a lot of tricks and tools that you can use to stop smoking \\xa0 many habits that we have are paired habits if we do one thing then we will do the other thing \\xa0think about the activities that you do when smoking and try to pair those activities with another activity other than smoking \\xa0for instance many people smoke while they drive \\xa0consider planning another activity to do while driving it might not be driving for you but you get the idea  \\xa0it might be taking a walk instead of smoking on your break at work \\xa0 \\xa0create distance between you and the habit you are trying to break \\xa0this approach could be used in a variety of different ways \\xa0if you smoke first thing in the morning consider leaving your cigarettes in a different room in your home \\xa0walking the extra couple of feet could help you decide not to smoke \\xa0 leave your credit or debit cards at home and carry less emergency cash than a pack of cigarettes \\xa0with this strategy you are trying to create some distance between you the cigarettes so that you have to jump through extra hoops to get them \\xa0 \\xa0consider cutting back before cutting out \\xa0if you are smoking  cigarettes a day try smoking  then cut back to  and so on \\xa0having a plan to reduce harm may be more sustainable than cutting things out altogether\\xa0 \\xa0you could also talk to your doctor about the safety of nicotine patches if you arent already pregnant this could be a great resource to help boost your success \\xa0 focus on what you are gaining instead of what you are loosing you may be losing cigarettes\\xa0but you are gaining money health taste buds an increased sense of smell lung capacity a healthy baby etc \\xa0you could plan small rewards treats with the money you save from decreasing cigarette purchases \\xa0i recommend\\xa0making these purchases small and frequent to keep up the momentum rather than waiting for a big payout a couple of months down the road \\xa0good luck cutting out cigarettes will be good for you and your baby \\xa0': 2473, 'being in this position is tough if seeking another career opportunity isnt viable there are a couple of things you can do to manage stress on the job\\xa0\\xa0 have a ritual to begin the day \\xa0consider setting a one sentence intention and plan tasks for the  take the breaks you are offered i know it can be difficult to step away from your desk to eat lunch or take \\xa0breaks during the day but prioritize this if you can sometimes  minutes of downtime and fresh air can help you feel better\\xa0 \\xa0have a ritual to end the day \\xa0if you commute by car consider an end of the day playlist \\xa0take a walk light a candle \\xa0clear your desk and write tasks for the next day whatever it is send a signal to your brain that it is time to end the  if you do work from home or are expected to be available\\xa0after hours set boundaries where you can \\xa0set a timer for answering emails and stick to that \\xa0have phone free meals \\xa0 \\xa0try to engage in activities that are rejuvenating like spending time the friends and family \\xa0 try to limit alcohol drugs \\xa0move as much as you can \\xa0get outside in natural sunlight \\xa0these are just ideas suggestions \\xa0even doing one of these things could be a step in the right direction \\xa0best of luck\\xa0': 2474, 'it sounds like you are on the right track recognizing these nagging thoughts of self doubt as imposter syndrome is a huge step in the right direction \\xa0from what you have written here it appears that you are able to challenge your own thoughts and provide yourself with evidence that counteracts the imposter syndrome \\xa0 continuing to remind yourself of what you have accomplished and looking at the facts at hand can help diminish doubt \\xa0remember many successful people battled imposter syndrome on the way to the top and still manage it \\xa0it might be helpful to read some of their stories so that you dont feel alone \\xa0the cut has a great article on  famous women on impostersyndrome and selfdoubt \\xa0 business insider has a great article about men and the imposter syndrome too \\xa0remember if you jumped through all of the hoops to get into school and get published you belong\\xa0': 2475, 'helloit sounds like you are really concerned about your daughter because you have noticed a significant change in her behavior  \\xa0 its really a great first step that you are reaching out to get some ideas about what might be going on  \\xa0you are clearly an observant and hands on \\xa0mom who wants to be sure that her daughter is okthis is a tough question to answer without more information  \\xa0with that said  i have found that under stress people regress \\xa0in other words  many people  children and adults alike  often regress and behave differently  as if they were younger than their actual age  when under stress  \\xa0 therefore  my first question would be  has anything been happening recently that is causing your daughter stress  \\xa0this could be anything from conflict at home  recent changes such as moving  divorce  a loss of some kind  switching schools  or losing a friend or friends  \\xa0 additionally  sometimes if children are feeling bullied or left out by same age peers  they may gravitate toward younger playmates as a way to boost their social confidence  \\xa0 \\xa0i would suggest that you think about what stressors  changes may have occurred recently \\xa0you may also want to check in with her teacher s to see if they have noticed any changes in your daughters behavior at school i also think that you can have a conversation with your daughter in order to see if you can get a sense about whether or not something has been bothering her \\xa0something as simple as  i have noticed that you arent spending time with the friends you used to hang out with  it seems like you have been playing with a lot of younger kids lately  \\xa0am i right about that   and then if she says yes you might ask a few questions such as  did something happen with your friends that \\xa0is making you not want to be with them has something been bothering you lately  are you feeling upset or worried  \\xa0if she denies that there is anything wrong you might even say  i know that sometimes when i feel stressed or worried  i tend to act a little differently  sometimes i withdraw from my regular group of friends  or i get cranky and feel less like myself  \\xa0i wonder if something like that is happening with you \\xa0if you are really concerned and not getting any answers from her and  or her teachers  perhaps you can consult with a therapist to discuss your concerns further and decide if it might \\xa0help for your daughter to talk to a therapist a few times  or at the very least you can get more specific tips from a therapist about how to approach this issue with your daughter more effectively  the more detail you can provide about what you have noticed with your daughter  including any changes or new stressors  \\xa0any possible patterns to this behavior  if school has become more difficult socially and or academically  the more a therapist can guide you about how best to handle your concerns and talk with your daughter in a way that is helpful to her\\xa0good luck \\xa0 i believe that this may just be a phase and it seems to me to be well within the normal range of childrens behavior \\xa0i do though think that you will feel more assured about this \\xa0if you can get to the bottom of whats going on  \\xa0': 2476, 'hi \\xa0this is an excellent question  \\xa0 i think that the answer probably varies depending upon the particular therapist  \\xa0in my work with people  once we have met and i have gotten an idea of the persona concerns and the issues they want help with  i spend the next few sessions gathering as much history and as much information about the clients current concerns in order to formulate some ideas about what may be causing distress  \\xa0i would then share my thoughts with the client to see if they feel i am understanding them and on the right track \\xa0we would then discuss the best plan to address the clients concerns  \\xa0usually i will suggest strategies that i think may be helpful and ask the client for feedback about whether or not they think my suggestions feel helpful  \\xa0 i always encourage clients to be really honest with me about this \\xa0i tell them that i would hate for them to agree to try things that they know they wont try just to avoid hurting my feelings or offending me \\xa0i want to be helpful and while i have the expertise as far as typically helpful \\xa0strategies i really like to work collaboratively and have clients tell me what they do and dont like  agree with or not agree with when i share my thoughts about a treatment plan  \\xa0we the \\xa0 work together to come up with a plan that will be helpful  but also realistic and then revise it and try new things if necessary as we go along \\xa0 if things arent improving  i am very happy and willing to try something new \\xa0i hope this is helpful for you \\xa0': 2477, 'hmm this is a tough one': 2478}\n"
