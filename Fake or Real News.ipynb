       "'Pope Francis used his annual Christmas Day message to rebuke Donald Trump without even mentioning his name. The Pope delivered his message just days after members of the United Nations condemned Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Pontiff prayed on Monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,  Francis said.  On this festive day, let us ask the Lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. The Pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue Trump continues to fight against. Francis used Jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the Child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus,  there is no place in the inn,  he said. Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head,  he added.  May our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of Bethlehem. The Pope said that Mary and Joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in Bethlehem. They had to leave their people, their home, and their land,  Francis said.  This was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child.   At heart, they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born; yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind. So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,  Francis said Sunday. We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. Amen to that.Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images.'"

      " chandigarh  farmers on sunday blocked roads in haryana and burnt effigies of prime minister narendra modi in neighbouring punjab  protesting against the farm bills passed in parliament two mlas from the jannayak janta party   jjp    which is part of the bjp led ruling coalition in haryana  also participated in the protests  reflecting a rift on the issue among their ranks farmers occupied portions of roads and highways at several places in the state between   and   pm  following a call given by the haryana unit of the bhartiya kisan union against the agri marketing bills  two of which were passed by rajya sabha on sunday after   pm  reports said the road blockades were lifted  ending the day s protests in which bku was also supported by several other farmer organisations in ambala   haryana police used a water cannon at the state s border to stop punjab youth congress workers from entering the district and travelling ahead to delhi as part of their  tractor rally  the punjab protesters set fire to one of their own tractors when they were forced to end their rally at the haryana border  police said farmers were joined by  arhitiyas    or the commission agents at  mandis    during their protests at many places in haryana there was heavy police deployment across the state  particularly where the bigger gatherings were expected police diverted traffic to alternative routes  executive magistrates were stationed along with police at many protest venues ambala nahan national highway near naraingarh  jind patiala and jind delhi roads near julana and sonipat gohana highway were among the roads blocked in haryana traffic was also disrupted on ambala chandigarh highway due to the protests by the punjab youth congress activists  but there was no blockade on the ambala delhi road the situation at the haryana punjab border was tense for a while as youth congress activists were bent upon moving on the national highway towards delhi but the spot was heavily barricaded by police  who also used water cannons to disperse the protesters farmers at several places in punjab burnt effigies and copies of the farm bills  claiming that the new laws will destroy their livelihood the three bills are aimed at giving farmers the choice to sell their produce at competitive prices  but many farm organisations fear they will lead to the dismantling of the minimum support price  msp  system two jjp mlas  jogi ram sihag  barwala  and ram karan kala  shahbad   participated in the haryana protests  going against the official line spelled out by the party s senior leader and deputy chief minister dushyant chautala sihag said he will not hesitate even to resign if his constituents want him to do that when at any point they feel that the farmers  interests are compromised chautala  however  hit out at the opposition congress and accused it of misleading farmers  nowhere in the new farm reforms there is any talk of abolishing the crop msp   he told reporters varun chaudhary  the haryana congress mla from mullana in ambala who joined the protest at mandour village near panjokhra sahib  said the bills were not a  shield for farmers  but for hoarders meham independent mla  balraj kundu  who protested in rohtak and charkhi dadri districts  claimed the bills will benefit the corporates  from october    i will sit on a fast to protest against these anti farmer measures   he said in yamunanagar  haryana bku chief gurnam singh said   it is the country s misfortune that despite the farmers  protest these bills were passed  he called it a  murder of democracy   laws are for people and if they are the ones who are protesting then for whose benefit have they been passed   he said   these laws are not pro farmers as the government claims  but the big corporates will benefit  he said the statewide protest was peaceful and   farmers  organisations extended their support punjab congress chief sunil jakhar  who also joined the youth congress protesters  said all parties except the akali dal and the bjp are with the farmers he slammed shiromani akali dal chief sukhbir singh badal  accusing him of earlier supporting these  black laws   the sad has pulled out of the union government in protest against the bills joining the tractor rally  indian youth congress president srinivas b v said his party stands shoulder to shoulder with the farmers  this government wants to destroy   crore families  former prime minister lal bahadur shastri gave the  jai jawan jai kisan  slogan  but under the present regime the farmers are ruined   srinivas said haryana congress president kumari selja said when a congress led government comes to power the law will be repealed  the party will hold protests on monday against the  anti farmer  bills at district headquarters across haryana on sunday  rajya sabha passed the farmers  produce trade and commerce  promotion and facilitation  bill     and the farmers  empowerment and protection  agreement of price assurance and farm services bill    the bills were passed by lok sabha on thursday  a third bill is yet to be passed in rajya sabha\n"
